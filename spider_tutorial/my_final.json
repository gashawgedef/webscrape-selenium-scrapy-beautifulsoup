[eerie music] On behalf of the Foundation I'd like to thank you all for coming. You are about to enter a safe space. A world free of judgment. Free of shame. In our house no fantasy is too obscene. S##t. ROMAN: All right, Miss Stella Marie, we're almost there. All right, perfect. \n \n \n \n    (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n \n Thanks again for driving me, hon. ROMAN: Mm-hm. Wouldn't be caught dead around here in the bug. ROMAN: I'm still not sure I want to just leave you here. You sure this gig is legit? It's a lot more legit than some of the s##t I have already done. All right, this is it. This is some weird s##t. [chuckling] Love you. ROMAN: Hey, Stella Marie. Keep your eyes open. [doorbell ringing] \n \n \n \n    (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n \n WOMAN (ON INTERCOM): Greetings. Password, please. STELLA: Pendragon. WOMAN (ON INTERCOM): Wonderful. [door creaking] DOOR GUARD: Welcome, madam. May I? STELLA: Oh. [clears throat] Turn, please. Excellent. I think we might have to adjust your hair. STELLA: Really? I thought that this was the right thing? At the door you will be assisted by another member of the Red Guard. They will instruct you as to the correct hairstyle. Throughout the evening should you need anything, anyone wearing a red shirt can assist you. STELLA: Right. Thanks. I'm sorry. Your invitation contains a very specific wardrobe code, and your compliance is mandatory for entry. STELLA: I'll get it right next time. DOOR GUARD: Wonderful. You are now E7. STELLA: E7. DOOR GUARD: Enjoy your evening, E7. [instrumental music] WOMAN: Welcome, madam. Turn, please. May I take your bag? STELLA: Oh, sure. The guy outside said I have to fix my hair. There you go. Have a wonderful evening. WOMAN: (SINGING) All by myself in the morning. All by myself in the night. I sit without you. Table and a chair. I wish you were there as I play Solitaire. [chattering] All by myself I recline. Your goodbye left me with eyes that cry. Watching the clock, without you. I can play the part that won't heal up my broken heart. You left me cold and I'm all by myself. [chattering] [unsettling music] Hey, you made it. STELLA: Jesus Christ. And I see you found your seat. STELLA: Oh, yeah. Yes. Under the romantic glow of the moonlight reflecting off the effervescent porcelain c###s. I'm very happy you came. I was worried I might have scared you off. STELLA: I don't scare easy. Well, that's good. [chuckles] [chuckles] You having fun? STELLA: Well, I actually just got here. This really is out in the middle of nowhere. Yeah. We find the cliff side setting to be a lot more relaxing. It's better to see the moonlight reflecting off the effervescent porcelain c###s. [chuckles] I'll introduce you to some of the regulars, OK? STELLA: Oh, I don't know. I don't want to come off as the bright eyed newbie. Let me prove myself first. Nonsense, Ste-- forgive me, E7. We're all equals here. There's no judgment. Come. Make friends. [instrumental music] These are the golden children. Playing games as usual. D8, Prince of the Forest. We've missed you. DANNY: Well, I'm very happy to see all of you. I'd like to introduce you to one of my friends. This is the charming E7. B1: Pleased to meet you. I'm B1. STELLA: Pleasure. I'm B3. That is a lovely top. So vibrant. STELLA: Thanks. B3: These rude w####s are B5 and B4. STELLA: So you're all Bs. You must be the Foundation's most frequent customers. Um-- What? E7 didn't get the usual tutorial. B1: That's odd. See, I thought it was mandatory for entry. You see, dear, the number system is based off of order of arrival. It's different every time. STELLA: Oh, so first come, first serve? DANNY: Yes. So, E7, what do you do? Or is that topic still on the black list? DANNY: Come, now. You know how Christian is. Christian just wants to be sure that everything is secure so that everybody here can have a better time. B1: Oh, yes. I know how Christian is. B5: Oh, come on. Where is our Royal Highness, King E8? Christian will be fashionably late, as usual. STELLA: But I'm E7. B3: No, no, sweetie. Christian is always E8. E8 is the king after all. STELLA: Where are we allowed to smoke? Um-- talk to that person right over there wearing red. They will point you in the right direction. STELLA: Great. I'll be right here, OK? You know, I'd recognize that voice anywhere. What are you playing at, Prince? D8: I'm not playing. STELLA: Excuse me, do you know where I-- uh-- MAN: Is everything all right? STELLA: Where are we allowed to smoke? MAN: On the patio. I can take you there. What is your name madam? STELLA: Stella Marie. I mean, I'm-- um-- uh-- um-- E-- E7. E7. MAN: Follow me, E7. STELLA: Oh, come on. I know I f###ed up. I won't do it again. I'm sorry. MAN: Please, just follow me. STELLA: I swear to God I won't do it again. MAN: That is true. STELLA: Where are we going? MAN: This way, please. [suspenseful music] Sire, I'm sorry to disturb you, but there may have been a breach in security. Would you mind inspecting her? Lance, my love, you are too free with your pronouns. We don't know how our friend here identifies. STELLA: I'm a girl. Good. [chuckles] What's your name, girl? STELLA: E7. Cool. May I? She looks good to me. Lance, I know we're being stricter than usual with security, but-- LANCE: As requested from the top, sire. But we don't have to be Nazis. Mistakes happen. People need to feel free to enjoy the balls. E7 here looked near tears when you brought her to me. STELLA: No, it's my fault. I went and said my stupid real name. Lance, thank you for everything that you do. LANCE: Your Highness. What is your real name? If you're comfortable. STELLA: Maria. Can I get you a drink, Maria? STELLA: Yeah, sure. [instrumental music] So what would you like to drink? STELLA: I'll drink anything. You must have more preferences than that. STELLA: Mm. What do you like to drink? Wilde Oscars usually. STELLA: [chuckles] I don't know what that is. Well, then you have to have one. DONNA: Coming right up, Your Highness. Oh, you're the best, Donna. I know. So-- Where did we meet? STELLA: In a store. Franklin's? STELLA: Yeah, that's the one. You had lighter hair then, yes? And you were buying six dozen yellow roses for a fundraiser. STELLA: Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I, uh-- I tried this blonde thing that didn't work. [chuckles] No, I thought it was lovely. I remember it. I remember recruiting every single person in here. STELLA: Must be nice. I have a terrible memory. Can I tell you a secret? Come here. Little closer. I lied. I actually can't remember everyone. I don't know who the f##k-- I can't remember. I don't know who let them in, what the f##k? [laughs] No, I have-- I have-- I have a terrible memory also. I do. I just-- DONNA: Two Wilde Oscars. Thank you, my love. Well, then, Maria. Here's to terrible memories. Though, hopefully, not quite so terrible tonight. [bell tolling] [clears throat] It's closing time. STELLA: Already? It's midnight, Cinderella. Drink up. Let's go. LANCE: Attention. A word from her Royal Highness, King E8, or as you may know her, X. [chattering] Well, hello everyone. This is a good turnout tonight. I'm so pleased to see all of you here. You know, sometimes I worry no one will... come. [chuckling] As you all know it is now closing time. For those of you who hope to leave the premises before 3:00 AM you have the next 15 minutes to exit the house. In the meantime, those of you who plan to stay for the After Hours events of the evening please note that the entrance to the house will be sealed. So no ins or outs, except in quick succession. The Red Guard will now come and collect your cell phones. Any of these devices found on your person will be confiscated, and you will only be able to leave at the end of the night after you have deleted any photos or videos that you have recorded. But other than that, tonight, anything goes. We expect-- nay, we demand that you have a pleasant time as long as you respect the privacy and boundaries of all other guests. Except for this b###h right here. [chuckles] The bar will be open for the next 20 minutes. After that, it will be closed for the rest of the evening. Any equipment that you may desire can be provided by the Red Guard. Please, do not hesitate to ask them for anything you may need before you engage. Safety first, everyone. Now, if you have a glass raise it. You're too kind. [chuckles] Now, please, give a warm welcome to the light of my life, our Queen. And you know I hate the nickname, but you insist on saying it anyway. GROUP: Prince of the Forest! CHRISTIAN: Yeah, yeah. Mr. D8 himself, here to announce the top bidder and winner of tonight's special prize. All right, baby. OK. I'm going to go get a head start on last call. I think I'm going to need it tonight. Well, first of all, I'd like to thank each and every you for your very generous contributions tonight. See anything suspicious tonight, watch dog? I don't think so. Not tonight. No one giving you trouble, right? No. But ask me again in 20 minutes. It's closing time. They better not. You tell me if they do, OK? Sure thing, boss. [MUSIC - THE MAJOR ARCANA, \"KNAVE\"] Dear, you're showing a lot of skin. MAN: (SINGING) Look, you see! Mm. [chuckles] I know. I should've picked something different. Nuh-uh. Not at all. I adore it. I haven't seen you around much tonight. Oh, I know I'm very late. I told the Queen that I wouldn't be here until after dinner and he said it would be all right. Dreadful. You missed a wonderful meal. No matter. The next one will be better. Now, you mustn't tell anyone-- I'm about to be very bad, but remind me where we met? I have had too much to drink tonight and my mind is foggy. The flower shop. I was picking out roses and you helped me settle on the color yellow. Yellow is so in season. MAN: (SINGING) He's got a girlfriend. Remind me what your number is. Oh, I didn't get a number. No? No. Um-- the Queen escorted me in. They said I could be H6, but they ran out of stamps. And that they must have miscounted or-- I understand. Uh-- H6, would you excuse me for a moment? I was supposed to say hello to someone a while ago and it slipped my mind until this very moment. Of course, gorgeous. See you later. Yeah. How you doing, E7? STELLA: Well, I'm going out on the floor soon, but I just had to pee for the last 45 minutes. I kind of have a tiny bladder. That's good to know. [chuckles] STELLA: Is this the only bathroom? Safety protocol. If it's the only bathroom then people notice if a guest is gone for far too long, or comes out sniffing. STELLA: Oh, smart. So when are you going out on the floor? You know, I-- I don't play very often. I like to be a cheerleader and watch. STELLA: Oh, you perv. Uh-- indeed. You know, E7-- [chuckles] I think I was a bit lax with my inspection of you earlier. Would you mind if I did another that was a bit more thorough? STELLA: Oh. [chuckles] More thorough? Just an innocent little thing. Could you take your mask off for me? I'll show you mine if you show me yours. Please? MAN: (SINGING) I feel it in my heart. It's true. STELLA: G##damn it. STELLA: Fine. Whatever you wish, sire. [tense dramatic music] Mm. Lance, at ease for a moment, but stay close. LANCE: Of course, sire. Stella Marie, how on Earth did you get in here? We met at the rose please, remember? Mm. You are not Anna Maria. What gave it away? Anna Maria. S##t. [chuckles] I-- I don't understand how you got the password. I was invited. But I invite everyone. Well, I don't know how this thing works. Are you going to kick me out? Not if you tell me who told you. I told you. I was invited. Look, I really, really, need to pee. I've had to pee for like an hour. You think I want all my friends to know I'm here? A lot of them don't even know what I am. I'm not gonna talk to anyone about your awful parties. Balls. Fine. I'm not going to talk to anyone about your awful balls. LANCE: Sorry, Your Highness. I spoke to the door guards. They've been extremely tight on security. [sighs] LANCE: No one seems to know what happened. It's all right. I know what happened. LANCE: Should I escort her out when she's done, sire? No, but, uh-- keep extra close tabs on her. I don't want to be worried about this for the rest of the night. I'm going to go sit in my chair for a moment and relax. LANCE: Very good, Your Highness. [quiet chattering] WOMAN: [inaudible] WOMAN: [moaning] Baby. [moaning] [MUSIC - TCHAIKOVSKY, \"DANCE OF THE CYGNETS\"] [toilet flushes] It's OK. You just have to talk to her. OK, people, it is massively too quiet in here. Let's get back to slurping, moaning, slapping, slamming. There's no need to stare. We've all had those little nip slips of the face. Am I right? Come on, baby. Talk with me over here. This way. This room right here. [sighs] It's OK. It really is. Listen, I've seen most of those people's faces many times. Trust me. It's very hard to toss someone's salad with a mask on. This is different and you know it. [sighs] So now they all know your secret. I'm telling you though, if you go back in there, you're going to learn all of theirs in about two minutes. It's fine. I don't know if this is my scene. I might just sit it out. I feel awful. I should have let Christian know. I should've known that she was going to be like this. To be honest she's gotten a lot better. Well, that's a scary thought. You know, Stella, everyone out there is just like you. No. Writers, graphic designers, business people. Who all know who you are. Which means they've all been getting off to you for quite a while. So I say you get back in there and you blow their minds. I have an idea. Stand up. Up, up, up. Face the wall gorgeous. All right, reciprocate. Take off your clothes for me. Go on. And-- [mimicking dramatic music] Look at the t##s on me now. [chuckles] Are you sure? DANNY: Positively. Now just lean on me, OK? And pretend like you've just had your brains f###ed out. [chuckles] WOMAN: [laughs] DANNY: Mm. Mm, mm, mm. I'll be right there. Wait for me. [rooster crows] Come on, let's pick up the pace. I want to get out of here before Seven wakes up. I'm coming. Why are you talking so loud and yelling and s##t? You think Four over did it a little? Nah, she's fine. Remember her during Christmas? B4: [groans] B4, if you puke in here you're going to be paying. This is premium package, b###h. All right? B4: F##k you. B5: Always talking s##t. [groans] Oh god, my back is killing me. I'm going to go to the chiropractor. B1: All right, who did the damage? It's hard to say. I think it was that girl who came late. Maria? The cam girl? That's right. The cam girl. Yes. Yes, yes. Mm. Yes, yes. B###h is cray, OK? They let her in without a tutorial or anything. Also considering her lifestyle-- I wouldn't let her see my face is all I'm saying. Girl, please. It's her word against ours. Who's she gonna tell? B1: Did you happen to see who she went off with? Well, I was tied to the bedpost most of the night, so. OK, so she wasn't the King's choice. [chuckles] Oh come, on one. Let it go. B5: Mm. Now, King Christian-- That girl is truly kinky. I mean she just comes down. She sits in her chair and she just watches. [dramatic music] CHRISTIAN (VOICEOVER): Most people don't understand this, but sometimes a good p##s is better than a good f##k. You tell someone that and they say, yeah, I guess. I see what you mean. No. No, you don't. You don't know what I mean. You don't know me. If you knew me you'd know I live in shame. Glorious. All consuming. Gut wrenching shame. [MUSIC - BEETHOVEN, \"SYMPHONY NO. 9\"] What would they say if they knew? The girls who come in to mop up the male fluids. The guy j###ing o##. The girl who pees to avoid the oncoming UTI. [groans] The bores who just f##k. Nothing dries me up more. Nothing intimate about it. Slamming body parts together. Sticky and red. God knows why they do it in the bathroom when they have the whole house. [groans] These people-- they'd call me every dirty degrading word they know. WOMAN (VOICEOVER): Pervert. MAN (VOICEOVER): Slut. D##e. MAN (VOICEOVER): Disgusting. Pig. MAN (VOICEOVER): W###e. CHRISTIAN (VOICEOVER): Hmm. I can't say that they're wrong. Watching people f##k can be just fine, but it's a sport. It's gymnastics or a horse race. It's not intimate though. You can f##k someone silly and never really know them. I know them the way no one does. You're only who you really are when you think no one is watching. I know them better than their mothers, their husbands, their best friends. Knowing that-- [moans] Turns me on. [moans] It makes me crazy. [moans] See? That's better than any video Maria has ever posted. [moans] [knocks on door] ALICE: Christian? Oh, I'm sorry. It's quite all right, Alice. Nothing you haven't seen before. ALICE: [chuckles] Maybe when we first got you when you were about 11. Well-- ALICE: You didn't have those knockers then. Well, they've only improved with age. [chuckles] What can I do for you? Oh, Ray called. He said Lynda won't get in the car. She claims she doesn't remember him. Great. Thank you, Alice. I'll whip you up something real quick so you can eat on the go. [moans] [instrumental music] LYNDA: Be careful now. You almost took my leg off. No, I did not. Yes, I think you did. Oh. OK, Ray. We're good to go. Mm-hm. And just like that she remembers my name. Well, the memory is a fickle thing, isn't it? Unbelievable. What? If you wanted to see me you could have just knocked on my door when you got home. I don't want to do that. I don't want to know the kind of things you kids are getting into nowadays. Oh my god. Let's go now. All right. What? You know what? Alice told me that you kept Ray here half the morning. Well, he doesn't mind, do you? That is what I pay him for. So, uh-- oh, you want me to call St. Catherine's again and tell them that you're sick dear? Hm? You could, but they'd be awfully confused, as I haven't been there in eight years. That-- that's a really long time. Can we just-- Oh, sweetie, you know, uh-- LYNDA: All right, sweetheart. I can take it from here. CHRISTIAN: [sighs] OK. Just remember to tell Alice to text me if you need anything else, OK? You know, sometimes you treat me like I am positively-- Dumb? Senile. I do know how to text, young lady. Of course you do. I'm sorry. Oh. Did you remember to deposit the check-- CHRISTIAN: I did. This week? And you're keeping up with the papers? Well, that's more Danny than me, but you don't need to worry about it. We've got it all under control. I-- no-- sometimes-- I know I give you a lot of flack, but I am very proud of you and your little friend. You're becoming quite the entrepreneurs. [chuckles] We're trying. I still don't know how you kids manage to make all that money. It's the internet. You can do just about anything nowadays with the right marketing. Oh. Well, the Foundation and I thank you. Take the day off. Yeah. Go do something fun. Go, um-- ride a bike. Yeah. No. Christian? Can you do me a favor and deposit the check again-- CHRISTIAN: Of course. This week. BOTH: Just one more time. DANNY: How's she doing? This morning she claimed not to know who Ray was so that I'd have to come and get her. DANNY: [chuckles] The woman is positively diabolical. DANNY: Yeah. Well, I know where you got it from. How did we do last night? A little worse than last month. And that's what you said last month. Hey, we are still far above budget, nervous Ned. Nothing to worry about. I think we need more guards the next time to avoid further security breaches. Listen, Christian. There's really nothing to worry about, OK? Everyone's really just used to the way that things are going now. And last night's breach was a tiny outlier in an otherwise very smoothly operating system. I know. I'm the one who created it, but we can't afford any more breaches. CHRISTIAN (VOICEOVER): Light of my life, Queen of my court, and as those imbeciles call him, Prince of the Forest. The only person with the wherewithal to orchestrate the balls right alongside me. The only person who I trust somewhat further than I could throw him. And the only subject who is, shall we say, off limits. Only uses the royal bathroom. What would I do without him? I know he lies to me now, but why? Under the pretense of making me happy? He thinks he knows what's best for me, but I won't be babied. Not even by him. You know, Christian. She's just a girl. Stella just so happens to be a girl who likes to-- CHRISTIAN: Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't realize you were on a first name basis. You don't call her by her cam name Maria? Don't be s####y. You want to get shut down over a porn star? OK, first of all, technically, she's not a porn star. All right? Secondly-- [sighs] Everything we're doing is perfectly legal. We're on private property and everybody loves us. OK? I mean they all love you. I hear what they whisper to each other every night. Oh my god. I think I'm finally going to get selected tonight. Did you see her? She looked right at me. She's so hot. CHRISTIAN: I'm saying this for the privacy and safety of our guests. Stella Marie might not be a threat right now, but we don't know everything about her. And the next breach could very well be someone with an ulterior motive. It's just facts, Danny. You're the most paranoid person I've ever met. We don't know much about half of these people. Not true. All of these people have had to pass the Christian test before they walk through the door. The Christian test. I forgot about the Christian test. The one you got a $5 million government grant for and spent 10 years of research developing that oh-so fail proof test. So sorry, my love. I know not what I do. Blow me. Not until you learn to chill out. She doesn't even have much to offer. I mean, I'm sure she makes a decent living doing what she does. But when you have to go out and buy new anal beads every week you-- Listen, Stella has other uses besides money. OK? She's very popular. People like her. She could be a draw to people if we decide to start expanding. Expanding? Are you insane? We can't fit any more people in that house. OK, OK, OK. We don't have to expand quite yet, all right? We could just publicize a little bit more. You mean like posters? No. Are you-- what? No. OK, how about the people who give $100 a month shouldn't be let in every single time? OK? Let's rotate the cheap f###s out every once in a while. CHRISTIAN: And what good would that do? It'll force people to donate more. You know? Or instead of scaring them we put a little positive pressure on them. And that's why you want Stella Marie there? Yes, it is. CHRISTIAN (VOICEOVER): No, no, no. You want her there because you think I'll stare into her big brown eyes and fall madly in love and everything will be dandy. I don't know if I'm comfortable with that. Why don't you give her a call and put her through your little test? That way we don't have to worry about this anymore. [MUSIC - THE MAJOR ARCANA, \"KNAVE\"] His basket's fat in his tight cats. Jack's ajax. Try to relax. His basket's fat in his tight cats. CHRISTIAN (VOICEOVER): The Christian test. While perhaps not as scientific as I would like to think, is not as random and faulty as Danny would like to think either. It requires the right instinct. Sleepless nights. Research. MAN: (SINGING) Right there HP. I think he looked right at me. CHRISTIAN (VOICEOVER): Then you need perfect timing. MAN: (SINGING) Jack's ajax. Try to relax. His basket's fat in his tight cats. CHRISTIAN (VOICEOVER): And then after all that-- excellent acting skills. MAN: (SINGING) He's getting close. Omi, can you tell? He talks so gross, but he looks so good. He feels so well like you know you should. Jack's ajax. Try to relax. His basket's fat in his tight cats. Jack's ajax. Try to relax. You say he doesn't play with spades. He only plays with hearts. But when he ogles me I see his Bijou basket of fruit tarts! He's a Jack of all suits, but only parks. When chips are down. When it gets dark. It's getting dark. Omi will get smart. His brand of naff tastes just like home. Oh, must you waste yourself? Homey polone. Try to behave. LMO-- he's my favorite flavor of fruit tart I savor. It's so cruel. He's just a fool. He's not a knave. CHRISTIAN (VOICEOVER): Eventually it all pays off. MAN: (SINGING) In his tight cats. CHRISTIAN (VOICEOVER): Though they have turned out to be some of my best customers, I can't say I have much affection for these types. MAN: (SINGING) He'll grab you, spike you, shake you, bite you, pin you to the ground and try to take you, fight you, spin you around. CHRISTIAN (VOICEOVER): They're obsessed with image, yet not committed enough to it to really create convincing characters. They want to be the cool kids, but don't want to be too eager to be cool. They think no one knows, but I do. I know everything. I don't have to catch every person with their pants down to be able to see right through them. [yawns] You know, sometimes I wish After Hours started at 8:30. MAN: (SINGING) His basket's fat in his tight cats. It's all the same. It's just like home. I'll give it some thought. DANNY: You should give her a call. I said I'll give it some thought. Good. Thank you for being open minded. Yeah, yeah. God. [groans] Christian, love, I'm going to be doing some baking this evening. Would you like a batch of scones? Sounds great. Are you doing Foundation work? Yeah. I do a week off and then a week on usually. LYNDA: Mm. You gotta keep your grades up. Right. Mm. The doctor was saying to me today that it's important for me to keep painting and keep baking. And I have to start to view my hobbies as a form of therapy. [MUSIC - TCHAIKOVSKY, \"SWAN LAKE\"] CHRISTIAN: Uh-huh. LYNDA: Christian, are you listening to me? Yes, Lynda. Jesus. LYNDA: You're not. I can tell when you're not. I am trying to get work done and listen to you at the same time. It is not my fault I don't have two heads. God! Just-- Damn teenagers. CHRISTIAN (VOICEOVER): I'd say I'd forgotten all about him, but it would be a lie. I could never forget my first. I just pushed him further into the back of my brain. I had to quell the longing somehow. Upon first glance Jackson was a typical meat head jock, but there was something else. [unsettling music] D##e. Hey, come on. Go say you're sorry. KID: I'm sorry, Christian! I didn't mean that. I'm sorry. CHRISTIAN: [moans] [thudding] Oh s##t. Oh god. Oh. Oh. So I am still worried about security, but I think maybe you could be right. DANNY (ON PHONE): [chuckles] She could be good for us, but let's just go slow on the expanding, OK? Take it easy on me. DANNY (ON PHONE): Yes. Yes, yes, yes. Of course. Of course. We don't have to expand beyond Stella at this ball. We can do that, maybe, the next time. Well, I mean, we could do like a tiny, tiny bit this time. Like-- well, what about this? Stella Marie's boyfriend. He-- why don't we invite him? He's dating her so he's probably a freak, and I'm sure he's harmless. DANNY (ON PHONE): Oh, I, uh-- I didn't know she had a boyfriend. Well, you need to really sharpen up your Facebook stalking skills. DANNY (ON PHONE): Why would I do that? I have you, the best Facebook stalker in the world. [mockingly laughs] So kind. DANNY (ON PHONE): What made you turn around? Usually just my bitching doesn't work. Well, you are an amateur bitcher. But I'm trying to give my mind a rest. You know? Trying not to end up like Lynda. [chuckles] Trust me, this is not the end of it. If anything goes wrong you will still be hearing about this when we are both 50 years old sharing a cell in the nuthouse. DANNY (ON PHONE): Great. Yeah. I knew this new Christian was too good to be true. [chuckles] I love you DANNY (ON PHONE): Love you too. OK. Bye. OK. [MUSIC - NANCY TRAN, \"LOVE\"] Hm. [moans] [bell rings] Dear friend-- [moans] The Foundation kindly welcomes you to a masquerade ball celebrating the spring equinox. NANCY: (SINGING) Love is a state of mind. [moans] The ball will take place at 1221 Sea Castle Way-- [moans] --on Saturday, March 19th, at 7:00 PM. Enclosed you will find specific instructions for the dress code. Upon your arrival a member of the Red Staff will assign you your identification number for the evening. NANCY: (SINGING) I've been living a dream. CHRISTIAN (VOICEOVER): On behalf of the red court I look forward to your attendance. NANCY: (SINGING) You taught me how to cry. Gold teardrops-- CHRISTIAN (VOICEOVER): Best wishes, X. NANCY: (SINGING) And I-- I try to clear my mind. And I am losing-- [moans] NANCY: (SINGING) --track of things. So I try to clean out my life. I'm still lost-- I can do that. What? NANCY: (SINGING) --in a dream. I can do it. Oh, no thanks. It's OK. NANCY: (SINGING) You taught me how to weep. The sun goes down, but I can't sleep. But I-- [moans] NANCY: (SINGING) --try. I'm gonna go home now. OK. NANCY: (SINGING) Oh love always fades-- [moans] NANCY: (SINGING) --with time. And I-- [screams] NANCY: (SINGING) --my dream. [sighs] STELLA (VOICEOVER): Hello, stranger. [MUSIC - TCHAIKOVSKY, \"DANCE OF THE CYGNETS\"] [phone vibrates] Hey! DANNY (ON PHONE): How is the boy toy? It's very casual. We just started dating. DANNY (ON PHONE): I have a little proposal for you. What do you think about doing one of those dance numbers you were telling me about? At the ball? DANNY (ON PHONE): Yeah. Everyone already knows who you are anyway. You may as well use it to your advantage. Spice things up a little. [chuckles] Are you crazy? DANNY (ON PHONE): Not as crazy as the other guests will go if you do it. Yes. Just get me some fishing line and a little hot wax. And I will go up there and do a little cancan. DANNY (ON PHONE): Well, if anyone could-- [chuckles] No. Are you f###ing nuts? Look, I have to go. I'll think about it. DANNY (ON PHONE): You promise? Yes, I promise. DANNY (ON PHONE): Ta, ta, my love. Oh. You are very early. Well, my dear I came to save you from a gluten overdose. CHRISTIAN: [chuckles] They're for the party. Why? CHRISTIAN (VOICEOVER): Because in 10th grade Jackson gave an about me presentation in Spanish class, and said his favorite flavor was cherry. Because they're delicious. And I think the guests will like them. I guess Lynda gave you her secret recipe. No. No? Let me show you something in the freezer. Is it a dead body? Holy wow. [chuckles] She made every last one for my after school snack. I can not believe it. You enslaved the senile songstress. No. The doctor says cooking is therapy. Yeah? I'm helping. DANNY: You are unbelievable. Oh my god. What is that? This is the prize for tonight. Ooh, what is it? Be very careful. Let me touch it. No. Let me touch it. No. Christian, be very careful. Let me touch it. It's 18th century erotica from Rome. Just be careful. Mm. Lovely. I know. You should put it down somewhere. Well, every surface is an ocean of scones. They might get lost at sea. Well-- oh, I guess that's fine. [chuckles] I got you something. Mm. Is it a golden scone? Please shut the f##k up just this one time. All right. I'm sorry. Mm. Dear god. [clears throat] For my Red Queen. Have you been embezzling? [scoffs] No. How did you manage that then? Every day Lynda gives me $10 for my allowance. Christian. I'm serious. No. This is awful. I can't accept this. OK. You have to tell her. I do. Every single day. She can see my face, Danny. It's not like I'm hoodwinking her. [sighs] I used to try to give it back-- put it in her purse. But she gave me the same bill over and over again every day for about six months. At some point what does it matter? I might as well use it for something important. So-- Yes? --the florist will be here in about 30 minutes. She's early because we're having around three times the normal number of flowers. And the music people aren't coming anymore because I did it all myself, including Stella Marie's request, which I thought was a little unoriginal, but hey it's her dance. Oh, and I got more candles 'cause the other ones are going [goofy vocalizing] Oh, and the ice is going to be here in about an hour, but I'm not sure if I trust those guys those guys 'cause they look like-- How do you breathe talking this fast? You did everything. I have nothing else to do. So what going to do is I'm going to have another one of these scones, and go j##k o## for the next three hours just to kill the time. Why are you being coy when you know I don't want you to be? What ever are you talking about? Did I do good? Babe, you did amazing. I can feel it in my bones. Tonight's going to be the night that we make those numbers bounce back. Fingers crossed. I have no doubt. Just, um-- What? Don't get your hopes up about whatever it is that made you do all this. It's just another night. Of course it is. Come here. Long live the King. CHRISTIAN (VOICEOVER): My darling Queen, I forgive you. [MUSIC - TCHAIKOVSKY, \"SWAN LAKE\"] [chattering] Now, don't let me have more than one of these. I want to go easy tonight. [gasps] I'm shocked. Leave her alone. Gosh. You know, I'm not try carry around a## out her. like I did last time. I don't want to get too smashed tonight, at least not until after the show. Yeah, I'm excited. Who knew baby girl could dance too? A woman of many talents. B1: Speaking of which. B5: Holy s##t. DANNY: Damn. Well, well, well. STELLA: Oh, you like? DANNY: I-- yes, I like. You came. I did. And you agreed to Danny's proposal. [chuckles] STELLA: Well, he was pretty adamant. Mm. STELLA: We mustn't disappoint the Queen. Indeed we can't. My lady usually gets what he wants. [chuckles] STELLA: Christian? Yeah? STELLA: What's wrong? Has anyone ever told you you're an excessively forward little bird? STELLA: [chuckles] I'll take that as a compliment. Nothing is wrong. I guess I'm just a little confused. STELLA: By what? I didn't think you were coming alone tonight. STELLA: That? I guess I haven't made things very clear, have I? I'm just a really private person now, if you can believe it? I can. We are only our true selves when we are alone. STELLA: Yes. Exactly. I'm not the same girl from St. Catherine's. Clearly, you aren't either. No. [chuckles] STELLA: I'd like to start fresh with honesty for once. I'd like that. STELLA: To be honest, I don't even remember why we stopped talking in high school. CHRISTIAN (VOICEOVER): Liar. I don't either. CHRISTIAN (VOICEOVER): And another lie. STELLA: Terrible memories. Mm. Right. [chuckles] I guess we're more alike than we thought, E7. STELLA: Tonight I'm C1. And in terms of me coming alone-- Jackson and I aren't officially dating. It takes a lot for me to make someone official. Oh. STELLA: But I also won't be alone tonight. He's just coming late. Well, um-- C1, privacy becomes you. And I am so glad for your honesty. STELLA: Yeah? You never know how the night's going to end around here. [chuckles] CHRISTIAN (VOICEOVER): A few more minutes to prepare. Maybe even a whole half hour. Perhaps I'll Donna to make the Bee's Knees double strength. STELLA: The only thing I've learned in life so far is to never think you know the answer. Well said. Uh-- excuse me, C1. I have to go-- I have to go tell Donna something. And get a towel. I'm a mess. Gosh, excuse me. STELLA: See you later. [MUSIC - TCHAIKOVSKY, \"SWAN LAKE THEME\"] So what was that all about? STELLA: Nothing. Oh my god. [laughing] [chattering] JACKSON: Sorry I'm late. Hey. They said to give this to you. BOTH: Hi. STELLA: Watch the mask. Oh, come on, on, take it off. Well, you cleaned up well. I love this. [chuckles] I've never seen this before. Oh my god. Can you even see me with this mask on? Oh my god. Chris. Sorry. Wow. Look at you. You look great. How are you? Wow. No one has called me that in a very long time. Oh, I'm-- I'm so sorry. Old habits, you know. This is incredible. Who would've thought, right? Quiet, bookish, little Chris. Well, I guess that's what they say, right? You always did work harder than the rest of us. I wasn't blessed with strength or charm so I kind of had to. Oh, nah, nah, kid. You were just a late bloomer is all. [chuckles] And you got my girl to perform. A master of persuasion as well. Well, that was my partner. Oh, your partner. Danny, my business partner. Oh, right. Well, I'm indebted to you both. She told me she'd never perform ever again. STELLA: I never said never. I said teaching takes a lot out of me. Ah. Teach? Well, I'm sure the girls thank you for it every day. STELLA: [chuckles] Uh-- I don't know if I told you this, but I'm a virtual teacher now. I teach English to girls in boarding school in Spain on my webcam. Wow. That's very good of you. Yeah. She spends all night by herself on the computer. My little baby's going to get carpal tunnel. [chuckles] I'm so sorry. Wow. That's dangerous. Yeah. Um-- Can I, um-- Can I get you a drink? My-- Donna-- she has created some specialty cocktails for tonight. That sounds great, Chris. Fantastic. All right, let's just, uh-- go to the bar. [chuckles] DANNY: (SINGING) The best things in life happen when you're dancing. STELLA: Oh, get the lampshade ready. Don't blame me, OK? You blame these drinks. They're the strongest I've ever had. And they go right through you. I mean, I've had to pee like 10 times. I've had three and I'm fine. Oh, well. STELLA: Well I shouldn't have any. I'm going to go get ready. Gotta primp. [chuckles] So you're the boyfriend? Uh-- that's a-- that's a strong word. Oh, is it? Pardon my French. What word do you prefer? Danny. Um-- we're just taking things easy, you know? Yes. No need to rush. I understand. You want to make sure you know everything about each other first, right? Hey, Danny, honey. I think maybe it's time for you to go get the stage set up. Aren't you doing that? No. We agreed it would be you. Oh. Can you just do it this once though? I need to make real good friends at this counter top right here. Regain some stability back in my life. Hm. Yeah. OK. Um-- I'll be right back. Thank you. You're the best King I ever had. AMBER: (SINGING) Lonely. I'll give the world if I could only. Mm. Mm. F###ing delicious. Try this scone. Sure. [chuckles] AMBER: (SINGING) It surely would-- Oh. See? So, man, tell me something. OK. Who are the freakiest chicks in here? CHRISTIAN: This all has to be perfect. Yeah, good. And then clean that all off. Clean all that off. Let's get all of their, um-- garbage from here. In fact, let's just get all the people out. Yeah. Um-- can you go get the blue light for me? To the right. DANNY: Here's one for that one. JACKSON: All right. Let's do it. DANNY: Very good man. Yep. Yeah. [chuckles] DANNY: All right, round two in two minutes. AMBER: (SINGING) I have tried in vain. JACKSON: [chuckles] You pussy. AMBER: (SINGING) To call your name. JACKSON: I might - DANNY: [chuckles] Alright. Go. Fine. JACKSON: I'll see you in a bit. AMBER: (SINGING) That will never make us part. STELLA: [heavy breathing] Christian. STELLA: [heavy breathing] LYNDA: (SINGING) All by myself in the mornin'. What? LYNDA: (SINGING) All by myself in the night. I-- Oh. What? Uh-- Oh, s##t. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. No. I'm sorry. No, no, no. No. No worries, dear. Sorry. I heard music. I thought this was just another part of the-- Oh, you know, Christian never tells me when she's planning to have company. [chuckles] Oh my god. Lynda Rue? Yes. [chuckles] Oh my god. You're-- you're Lynda Rue? LYNDA: Yes. She didn't warn you guys? [chuckles] Yeah, I figured that. Of course she didn't. This is your house? Yes. She won't let me join the PTA. She's worried-- too much attention drawn to her. I don't know. [chuckles] Well, I never knew. Now you know. Silly me. There we go. How do you do? Lynda Rue. Hi. Hi, I'm Stella Marie. Um-- Christian and I-- we were in the same class. You were? Of course you were, love. Oh my goodness. Well, how are you? I mean, is Christian having a few friends over right now? Um-- uh-- yes. LYNDA: Well-- well, good. Yeah. We're just having a little party. No. No worries, you know. All you St. Catherine kids-- you're good kids. I know you're going to clean up after yourselves. [chuckles] You know, I think I'm going to just pop my head in for a moment, huh? What do you think? Let's do that. [hums musically] Something like that. Ooh. [piano music] Could you get me-- [inaudible] [chuckles] Could you hold this for me, dear? I just have to take care of something. No worries. LYNDA: Slide it in. [MUSIC - LYNDA RUE, \"ALL BY MYSELF\"] So handsome. (SINGING) All by myself in the mornin'. GROUP: [cheering] (SINGING) All by myself in the night. [suspenseful music] WOMAN: Oh my god. That's Lynda Rue! Lynda who? OK? S##t. F##k. S##t. I'm dead. LANCE: Excuse me. Okay, slow move. I didn't or-- [interposing voices] LYNDA: (SINGING) Playing solitaire. I get lonely. Watchin' the clock on the shelf. I'd love to rest my weary head on somebody's shoulder. I hate to grow older all by myself. All by myself in the mornin'. All by myself in the night. I sit alone with a table and a chair. So unhappy there. Playing solitaire. All by myself. I get lonely watching the clock on the shelf. I'd love to lay my weary head on somebody's shoulder. I hate to grow older all by myself. All by myself. GROUP: [cheering] Thank you. [inaudible] Thank you. GROUP: [cheering] LYNDA: So glad you can all be here. If you don't mind I'm going to retire to my bedroom. Please enjoy the party. Hey. Take me. Take me. [interposing voices] B3: Perfect. It's perfect. Who thought of that? B5: Who came up with this? Prince, come on. Come on. Walk with me now. I'm about to pay you. DANNY: All right, ladies and gentlemen, we're not done yet. To the stage-- Where is my Christian? Oh, my sweet King darling, where are you? It's OK. I'll find her in a bit. I can go it alone. Let's give a nice big, warm, round of applause to a burlesque queen on the rise. Miss Maria. [MUSIC - THE MAJOR ARCANA, \"AT THE DEVIL'S BALL\"] MAN: (SINGING) I had a dream last night that filled me full of fright. I dreamt that I was with the Devil below in his great big fiery hall. Where the Devil was giving a ball. I checked my coat and hat and started gazing at the merry crowd who came to witness the show. And I must confess to you there were many there I knew at the Devil's ball. In the Devil's hall, I saw the cute Mrs. Devil, so pretty and fat, dressed in a beautiful fireman's hat. Ephraham, the leader man, who led the band last fall. He played the music at the Devil's ball. In the Devil's hall I saw the funniest devil that I ever saw taking the tickets from folks at the door. I caught a glimpse of my mother-in-law dancing with the Devil. Oh, you little devil dancing at the Devil's ball. DANNY: [chuckles] All right. Ladies and gentlemen, let's give one more round of applause to this burlesque queen, Miss Maria. Hey, baby. Hey. Don't touch me. OK. Well, it looks like you're drinking wine. That's Lynda's wine, dear. It's my house. OK, well, why don't you go get a drink from the bar, all right? It's closed, remember? OK. Well, you're drunk enough as it is. Oh. Look who's talking. Come on. This is not my fault, OK? It's you that made the drinks that strong, all right? I saw you over there whispering things to Donna into her ear. You don't think I see these things, but I do. CHRISTIAN: Yeah. I can say whatever the hell I please to Donna without your assumptions. Thank you. Why are you so angry Christian? You know, I have about $12,000 in my suit pocket right now? This is the best ball we've had yet. Yeah. Thanks to burlesque grandma and her sidekick Maria, cum facial princess. Oh, Jesus Christ. Come on, Christian. What the f##k are you even talking about? You weren't there, OK? The crowd was loving it. It was just great. A nice little surprise. Honestly, it really worked in our favor. Right. What the hell is even your issue with Stella Marie? She doesn't do that kind of s##t, OK? That's seriously really judgy of you. CHRISTIAN: Well-- [sighs] My issue is-- Yeah? --that she wasn't even supposed to be here in the first place. I don't trust her. I didn't trust her! And now I'm proven right. Great or not, she went wandering through my house, and that proves it. Proves what? Oh my god. It proves that she's the same as she was in high school. DANNY: OK. That she's always-- always spying on me, and judging me, and digging into my secrets trying to figure out how to destroy me. Shh. She meant no harm, Christian. How could she know that was Lynda's room? Not everything is about you. Of course you vouch for her. You brought her here. You snuck her into the last ball. Come on. Don't deny it. You know, I just thought that-- You just-- you just thought that what? That you knew best? Like always? Always belittling me and making me feel like I'm crazy. You are a little crazy. You are so naive. DANNY: I thought maybe you liked her. [MUSIC - TCHAIKOVSKY, \"SWAN LAKE THEME\"] [gasps] What? DANNY: I mean, you're always talking s##t on her. You're always saying mean things. And then I go and meet the girl and I'm thinking to myself, this girl's actually a really, really sweet gal. And I'm wondering-- CHRISTIAN: [chuckles] --why has Christian always said all this mean stuff about her? And then I realized it. You actually like her. CHRISTIAN: [chuckles] It's not that crazy of an idea. I mean, everyone up there really likes her. People hate her. They think she's trash. DANNY: What are you talking about? They've just come here to watch the freak show. DANNY: I get it. You're jealous. You're jealous. [chuckles] People actually like Stella for something that she does. Whereas people like you because you're all mysterious, and weird, and you make people think that you're going to f##k them, but then you don't. You don't think I see you sitting here on your f###ing couch every night? Danny, stop. You're also so f###ing arrogant. You can't even stand a real genuine person who actually has talent and drive. Genuine? Yes. She lied to Jackson. He doesn't even know what she is. Who gives a flying f##k about Jackson? Some meat head jock she nails every now and again. They're not even together. You know that? But why does she get the title genuine, and I get the title jealous and crazy? DANNY: Because, Christian, you have it good. She has to make it on her own in a world that hates people like her. And you have everything you could ever possibly want, but you are still not satisfied because at the end of the day it's Lynda that bought it for you. Yeah. Yeah, that's right. And-- and instead of-- instead of being grateful for what you have-- CHRISTIAN: Danny. --you have to twist it into this sick little inadequacy You have to make it how everyone else in the world is out to get you. You can't even take-- DANNY: --a simple f###ing gesture. Danny, could you, please, just-- DANNY: You have to take everything the wrong way. Just-- would you, please-- DANNY: You have to pervert-- --just shut up! [groans] [MUSIC - TCHAIKOVSKY, \"SWAN LAKE THEME\"] [sighs] Danny. Danny. S##t! S##t! S##t! F##k. [sighs] CHRISTIAN (VOICEOVER): I've never watched the live feed before, but I'm not going back up there now. [suspenseful music] What the f##k? What the f##k? As though this night couldn't get any worse. So she remembers. She's the only one who ever a caught me in the act. The only one who could possibly ever suspect a camera. It's not there or there. [scoffs] And Danny thinks I like this girl. Move the towel. Move the towel, Stella. [scoffs] [electronic beeping] [suspenseful music] B1: All right, I'm just going to say it. I think that was the best one yet. Hands down. Even better than the one in October. B5: Mm-hm. B3: Agreed. B4: I think I gave the Prince my entire trust fund. B5: I think one of the Red Guards all of my cocaine. [dramatic music] What the hell is on this memory card that's so important? [phone rings] STELLA (ON VOICEMAIL): Hey, this is Stella. Leave a message. [phone rings] Should've backed it up. [phone rings] [phone rings] STELLA (ON VOICEMAIL): Hey, this is Stella. [phone vibrates] This sort of thing happen often? Ah, she's a little bit volatile, but nothing like that's ever happened. Yeah. She was so mellow when we were kids. Yeah. Well, no offense, but you didn't really know her back then. Fair enough. I don't know what to do, man. Maybe cut it off. Hey, here are your wings. Oh, beautiful. [chuckles] Just in time. I gave you two extra. I can see. You're the best. How are you? Uh-- I've been better. It's OK though. Yeah? Yeah, it's good. How's Christian? She's, um-- she's doing well. Yeah. We're all a little bit hung over so she took the day off. Thank you for everything. Mm-hm. Tell her I say hi. Definitely will. Yeah, thanks a lot. OK, bye. Yeah, uh-- that was a bad night. What are you talking about, man? I thought you had a good time? [coughs] Well-- What? Listen, I gotta tell you something. I, uh-- I think I did something kind of bad. WOMAN: (SINGING) Singing every song. [tense music] CHRISTIAN (VOICEOVER): I can't stop thinking about her. She's the only person who could possibly have known about the camera. The only one who could've taken the memory card. Did she sober up, go back, and find it? [phone rings] Did she take it to f##k me over or to save herself? Use it as evidence to go to the police? STELLA (ON VOICEMAIL): Hey, this is Stella. Leave a message. CHRISTIAN (VOICEOVER): Where are you? I have to relax. I-- I can't f###ing think straight. Just for a minute. [unsettling music] God f###ing damn it. I'm f###ing disgusting. F###ing slut, d##e, pervert. Christian? Oh-- What? [chuckles] What? Oh my god. Could you knock? I'm not dressed. I was just-- came to check on you. You've been in here all day. Well, I'm pretty g##damn tired. OK? Why are you so tired? CHRISTIAN: [groans] I've got a lot on my mind. What? Your AP test isn't for two months. Oh my god. Why are you yelling? Don't you know anything? [chuckles] What is this attitude that I'm getting? I swear to god I'm going to kill myself. [sighs] Why are you being so difficult? There is no AP test, Lynda! Why are you so moody? I don't know. Maybe it's because I'm a teenager going through puberty. Oh, no. It's because I'm 26 g## damn years old and living with a person who thinks I'm 12! I do not think that you're 12. [chuckles] Could you leave me alone? Sweetie, Christian-- Please? Fine. All right. Don't have to be such a little b###h about it. I have to find her. Oh my god. [wind rustling] JACKSON: Christian. Hey, Chris. What are you doing down here? Just walking. Oh, right. Where are you headed? Um-- That way? I'll walk with you. I think it's a shortcut anyway. That makes no sense. Sure it does. You know, Chris, I've, uh-- actually been meaning to talk with you. Really? Yeah, um-- I think-- I think you may be in need of some help. With what? I know everything you do. You-- you mean well. You never try to hurt anyone. How do you know that? Well, you have a good heart. I can tell. Look, Chris, I think-- I think you and I both know you made some mistakes at that last party. Did some things you shouldn't have. We all do things we shouldn't, don't we? [chuckles] You know, I always said you were smarter than the rest of us. I am. Look, kiddo, I know-- I know everything. You know what? The fight. Well, the mirror. The camera. Yeah. [sighs] You? Mm-hm. Well, someone has to make it stop. I see. But then who will stop you? Stop me? Well, I saw. Before the card disappeared I watched live. That's not normal. Neither is what I saw. [chuckles] I don't think you know what you're talking about. I think I do. Look, Chris, just take it out of there. Never do it again. Nobody has to know. You'd like that, wouldn't you? I don't know what you're implying, but the camera doesn't have any sound. I don't think you can be sure of anything. I know what I saw. Yeah. Well, you're never going to see it again. Why don't you go home, princess? [chuckles] [dramatic music] [phone rings] DANNY (ON VOICEMAIL): Hi, there. This is Danny Peterson. I am not at my phone right now. Uh-- leave a message. Hi. It's me. I-- I don't know what to do. I just really need you to answer me. [groans] Things are bad. Things are awful, [chuckles] I f###ed up with you and me, and-- with some other stuff too. I don't-- I don't know where else to turn. I know I don't deserve it, but, please, if you still care about me at all just call me back. I miss you. I made some awful mistakes and I didn't trust you. I didn't trust you because I'm a liar. I f###ed up, I felt bad, and I put it all on you. I don't expect you to forgive me. But, please, don't leave me. Text me or call-- Your recording has reached maximum length. [shouts] STELLA: Christian? Hi. What are you doing here? Just-- I was just looking for you. Did you come to tell me about that thing with Jackson? Yes. STELLA: Well, you don't have to. I don't? I broke up with him last night. He, um-- he found out about my secret. And it was just-- it was just all bad. Are you OK? Yeah. Yeah. I'm fine. Are you? Yeah. I'm-- I'm fine. Do you want to come inside? I don't know. I have some good news. What? So-- the day after the last ball. I randomly get a call from a theater downtown. And they do vaudeville revival shows. And they hired me to dance burlesque for them. Wow. That's great. You have talent. Thanks for coming to see me. It really means a lot to me that you care. Of course I do. What are you going to do about Jackson though? Mm. Let's not-- let's not talk about that. But I'm OK. Should I do anything? Do you need any help? I'm a big girl. I'll figure it out when I have some time. Thank you for everything. I'll text you. [tense music] CHRISTIAN (ON VOICEMAIL): Don't leave me. RECORDING (ON VOICEMAIL): To delete this message press-- I'm sorry, bro. I know this is like the worst thing that could've happened to you. Yeah. I don't know if you'd be interested, but we, um-- we're looking for someone in the marketing team in my office. Maybe you should leave the Foundation for a while. [sighs] I mean just-- just give it some time, and then you can rethink your relationship with her. Yeah, maybe. She needs a lot of help, Danny. When I saw her today she was just positively manic. She was just walking up and down the streets aimlessly. Well, she needs to go to rehab, or she needs therapy, or something. I don't know. Well, maybe being away from her best friend for a bit will help her see that. Maybe you're right. What did you do with the card? JACKSON: The card? DANNY: The memory card. I deleted it. Threw it away. [phone rings] [phone vibrates] [unsettling music] DANNY (ON VOICEMAIL): Hi there. This is Danny Peterson. I am not at my phone right now. Uh-- leave a message. B3: What the f##k? B5: What is this? B3: How long has this been going on for? B4: How much more footage is there? B5: I know this is bad. B3: Who knows where this is going to end up. B5: Maybe no one will see it. B4: Like, she-- she won't f##k me, but she wants to see my t##s? This b###h-- I gave her so much of my money. Christian. There's something you need to see. B5: I trusted-- B4: God, I would've f###ed her if she asked. B5: And now-- B4: And it's on the internet. My parents are going to see it. B5: The damage is done. CHRISTIAN: Danny. DANNY (ON PHONE): Hey, Christian. CHRISTIAN: Danny. Thank you for calling, I really-- DANNY (ON PHONE): I wouldn't just not call. I just needed to think first. CHRISTIAN: I don't know what to say. DANNY (ON PHONE): [sighs] I don't really either. I'm so sorry. I know that's not enough. I know nothing will be enough, but-- DANNY (ON PHONE): I'm sorry too. I'm sorry for what you're going through, even if-- It's all my own fault. [chuckles] DANNY (ON PHONE): I have to leave, honey. OK. DANNY (ON PHONE): There's no other way this just-- isn't right for me anymore. Yeah. I understand that. But just could-- can we talk in person? I have some things I want to tell you. I'm not going to ask you to stay. I just-- I want you to know something. DANNY (ON PHONE): I can't do that. Why? DANNY (ON PHONE): I can't face you right now. Just for 10 minutes? I-- I promise I won't ask you to stay. DANNY (ON PHONE): I can't. Why? DANNY (ON PHONE): Because you'll make me change my mind, and I can't afford to do that with you, Christian. Everything is f###ed. My life is f###ed. I'm really g##damn lucky Jackson was able to get me another job. Danny, please, can we just talk? And don't take that job with Jackson. Don't do anything with Jackson. I'll try-- I'll do something to make it clear to people that you weren't any part of-- DANNY (ON PHONE): Christian, stop. I'm not coming back. I can't. It's too much at once. But I need to talk. DANNY (ON PHONE): Look, I will tell everyone I meet, from here until the day I die, that you're a good person. And you don't deserve this s##t no matter what you did. That you're worth a hundred of these people, but I can't stay with you anymore. I can't. I'm sorry. [MUSIC - TCHAIKOVSKY, \"SWAN LAKE THEME\"] CHRISTIAN: Danny, are you there? Danny? [groans] [screams] WOMAN: Pervert. MAN: D##e. MAN: Disgusting. [groans] S##t. [yells] Oh, s##t. F##k. [chuckles] [MUSIC - TCHAIKOVSKY, \"SWAN LAKE THEME\"] [chuckles] [cries] DANNY (IN MEMORY): You have to take everything the wrong way. CHRISTIAN (IN MEMORY): Would you, please-- DANNY (IN MEMORY): You have to-- DANNY (IN MEMORY): --pervert everything. CHRISTIAN (IN MEMORY): --shut up! [cries] [audience applauding] JACKSON: It's OK. It's OK. You did the right thing. It's over now. I swear to you on my grandmother's grave I have no idea how that footage got out. I mean, maybe she did it to herself. You know, maybe she felt like she-- she needed to confess. And this was the way she had to do it. Why don't I go out? Hm? Why don't I get us a nice bottle of wine. We've both had long days. We need to relax. Yeah, that sounds like a good idea. OK. [unsettling music] I hope it's all right. I decided to get beer instead. Danny? Danny? STELLA: Oh my god. Jesus Christ. I realized I never returned your keys. Well, you could have returned them without giving me a heart attack. Sorry. I, uh-- I also wanted to see how you were doing. I promise I'm fine. I don't care about that stupid video. People have seen way worse than that. Yeah, I meant with, uh-- you know? Yeah. I want you two to be happy. Yeah. About that. I also wanted to talk to you about that. Um-- what happened at the party-- I'm not going to deny that I participated. It's just-- I was extremely drunk and what happened after I-- Let's just say I was never fully consenting. And I got myself in a bad spot where I didn't want to hurt someone's feelings. We're not together. I'm not that way. I just-- I made a mistake out of curiosity. And then I got cornered by this person who was very, very, drunk, and then had no self-control. What are you saying? [sighs] Nothing. Nothing. I just-- I just want you to understand that-- that I didn't not fight the breakup because-- because I'm gay or something. I did-- I did it because I think you deserve someone who wouldn't embarrass you the way that I did. I-- I wanted better for you. Well, thanks for that. You're a good person, Stella. I think you deserve a good guy. [MUSIC - TCHAIKOVSKY, \"SWAN LAKE THEME\"] [knocks on door] Hello. Hi. Hi, I'm Christian's friend. Mm-hm. Um-- can I come in? Um-- all right. STELLA: What are these? Oh, they're for the Foundation. I can take them to her. Where is she? Oh, she's in a room. She's been sleeping quite a bit lately. [clears throat] [coughs] CHRISTIAN: [groans] No. No. [sighs] How do you keep getting in here? You look like you're dying. I'm fine. I am free. Finally free of people and their stupid opinions. That's just swell, but that doesn't mean that you shouldn't, you know, get dressed at some point -- [groans] STELLA: --in the day. I'm sorry. Does this bother you? [goofy vocalizing] [chuckles] Why are you here? Bringing you these. Ooh. STELLA: What are all these anyway? Ah. RSVPs. STELLA: Those idiots still want to come back? Probably just to tar and feather me. Well, this is a g##damn mess. What do you care? Isn't this what you wanted, Miss Nosey? The emperor caught without his clothes. Wait. What do you mean what I wanted? Why the f##k would I want any of this? CHRISTIAN: [chuckles] Please, don't play all innocent with me now. You used to follow me around in high school trying to figure out who my parents were. OK, I was 16. Caught me coming out of the men's bathroom, and called me names. What? CHRISTIAN: [sighs] You know what I'm talking about. [unsettling music] Oh my god. You're a total pervert, aren't you? Oh my god. [chuckles] You think this is funny? STELLA: No. No. No, not really. CHRISTIAN: You really didn't remember at all? STELLA: Well, not that part. CHRISTIAN: How did you get into the first ball? STELLA: Danny. CHRISTIAN: Why did he want you here? To try and set us up. Uh-huh. And why did you search every drawer in the guest bathroom last weekend after your performance? What were you looking for? You're a f###ing psycho. You're a parody of yourself, you know that? I was on the rag. I was bleeding through my g-string. I was looking for a tampon. You have 10 different types of condoms in there. CHRISTIAN: [chuckles] Every lotion known to man, but no f###ing tampons. What kind of woman are you anyway? I'm not a woman. I'm a pervert. A dog. A pig. [oinks] You're a loon. That's what you are. CHRISTIAN: Mm. And what about Lynda? What about her? CHRISTIAN: Why did you go to her room? It's not even in the main house. I was looking for you. How'd you hurt your arm? Well, I got upset. There was more to that footage. Things that got cut out. That night I was watching all of you live and I saw something. Something really, really, bad. Happen to someone who I thought was you. STELLA: Because he had my mask. What happened to him? Jackson happened to him. JACKSON: I was extremely drunk and let's just say I was never fully consenting. Oh my god. We have to tell him. He has blocked my number. Let's go over there and tell him right now. We can't. Why not? We have no evidence. The footage is gone. Deleted. Dying in a trash file on a computer in a public library no doubt. So what? Let's go over there and tell him anyway. CHRISTIAN: You don't understand. If I tell him I will look like an absolute monster. Making up atrocities just to get him to talk to me again. I can allow him to believe that I'm a pervert, a psycho, a b###h, but not that I would concoct a rape just because I am sad. The day that you came to see me. You thought it was me? And you didn't have any evidence of what happened then. CHRISTIAN: Well, the world didn't know I was a pervert then. Also I hadn't punched you in the face two days earlier. Well, what if we could convince the world that you weren't a pervert? [chuckles] How would we do that? Lynda. What? STELLA: We say that Lynda was paranoid. And that she was old and scared. And that there were cameras all over every inch of the house because she was terrified of the paparazzi pestering her. And that she wanted to be left alone because she was sick. I'm not going to do that to her. She has a perfect, unblemished, reputation as a saint. It won't ruin her reputation. No one's going to blame a little old lady for being paranoid of the paparazzi spying on her. We say that someone, somehow, found the camera in the bathroom. They stole the memory card. That we have no idea who it is. No one's to blame. And Lynda won't even remember the brief news blip. If she even sees it. It's not right. It's also not right not telling Danny. You can shut the f##k up. You think you know everything? You tell him. Go put the cherry on the top of his already fan-f###ing-tastic sundae. That's what I thought. And you know I'm right. You know I'm right about Lynda. You know the whole reason why Lynda put the Foundation in my hands. The whole reason why she isn't in the public eye is because she wanted to be remembered as Lynda Rue, the singer. She didn't want everyone thinking of her as, oh that beautiful singer who is now old and fragile. That woman who used to be talented, but has now lost her mind. I won't let the last thing about her in the world's collective consciousness be that she was a paranoid freak who kept cameras in her bathrooms. That would be the ultimate betrayal to her. Also I should probably stop lying. STELLA: You're going to stop lying? Yes. STELLA: You're going to tell the truth about everything? Yes. STELLA: Do you like me? CHRISTIAN: What? Did I stutter? You're ser-- you're seriously going to ask me that right now? You're deflecting. [chuckles] OK, I think it is seriously f###ed up that you're laughing right now. STELLA: And why is that? Because my life is in ruins. This whole thing is funny because none of this would have happened if you weren't so afraid to answer my first question. I don't know what you're talking about. You are a scared, scared, little child under all that pervy exterior. OK. You can shut up now, really. Now you're just being a b###h. [unsettling music] [gasps] [moans] Mm. Nuh-uh. No don't. Christian-- No don't touch me. STELLA: You're a little damaged aren't you? I think I preferred it when you called me a pervert. STELLA: All right, then. You're on your own. It's your cross to bear. First off, I'd like to thank you all for coming. Five years ago Lynda Rue entrusted me with her foundation. I have broken that trust. Everything you have heard, speculated, feared-- it's all true. I am a creep. I am a deviant. A voyeur. A pervert. I will no longer be a liar. In the guest bathroom I kept a hidden camera. I am sure many of you wonder why I didn't just lie. I could easily have chalked it up to a little obsession with security. I could even have blamed one of you. It would have been easy. Multiple people have told me that, but-- but I won't. I won't do that to any of you. You came here with purer intentions than I. And though the world may judge you for those intentions. I-- I want all of you to know that I have also been caught with my pants down. [chuckles] I wish I could have kept your secrets and my own safe, but I failed. Though I have made the decision to be honest I must admit that not much else has changed. I will continue despite everything to hold events for the Foundation every month. What? And at each of these events After Hours will continue as it has for your pleasure. And in the guest bathroom there will be a camera. Though now the guests will be checked and the camera will be inspected to ensure it still has its card. Your secrets will remain within these walls, but I will still be watching. As I always have been since the very first event here almost five years ago now. If this does not suit you I will not judge any of you for leaving. While I have watched over each and every one of you, though in ways to which you did not consent, please know that no matter what act, environment, or object you used to find your ecstasy I looked on you with the eyes of an admirer. Not the eyes of a judge. I hope you can forgive me. [chuckles] And extend this poor pervert the same freedom from judgment even though I do not deserve it. Thank you. [sighs] LANCE: OK, that's it you're out. Get-- hey. [thumping] [groans] B1: Hey, hey, come on. LANCE: Hey, hey. B1: Let her go. LANCE: OK, that's it. Get out. You're out of here. OK.

Anyway, you know where to find me. Looks like your party got a little out of hand, kiddo. Yeah. I guess I don't really know what I'm doing. It's all right. Lance is on it. He'll kick 'em out. You need a blanket. Leave the scones. Thank you. WOMAN: [yells] I didn't think you'd come. DANNY: Liar. You didn't have to, you know? I know. AMBER: (SINGING) All by myself in the night. They're going to tear the house down. Yeah. But still this is the best turnout we've had so far. [chuckles] [chuckles] Besides, everybody loves a good pervert. CHRISTIAN (VOICEOVER): It was just the kind of thing Danny would say, but as it turns out some fantasies are too obscene. AMBER: (SINGING) Your goodbye left me with eyes that cry. Watching the clock, without you. I can play the part, that won't heal up my broken heart. You left me cold and I'm all by myself.

Would you believe a lone mother who is unfit to pay her mortgage and also raise her rebellious teenage daughter?

Personal dramas and a murder mystery unfold in present-day Budapest, where demonstrations are part of the pre-election life of a city still trying to cope with the shadows of its historical and recent past.

We investigate these unusual deaths with administrative procedures. Only 2 percent are proven to be the result of foul play. But last week, 3 such cases occurred, which extends way beyond the statistical margin of error. 2 of these are my cases, and one case has already been closed by our colleagues. Here, the victim didn't pull the handbrake, \n \n \n \n    (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n \n and his own jeep ran over him in the garage under the sloping driveway. We closed the case. The circumstances are clear. The bloody print of the back wheel is obvious. The front wheel isn't bloody yet. That's what ripped open the abdominal wall. If he'd simply been run over once, the abdominal wall would only have torn on the forward direction side. The photo shows that the blood and intestines spilled in both directions. So the wounds are nearly symmetrical. The back wheel went over him twice: Once in reverse and once forward. This victim was murdered. - Sorry, boss, duty calls. We gotta go. - Just a minute. Éva, you just sit in the basement. Never go out to the crime scene. Designated unfit for investigation. \n \n \n \n    (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n \n This is a closed case. You say your colleagues haven't done their job right? No. But here, the dog's teeth marks... Éva, this is absurd. All doors and windows were closed. Locked. How could another dog appear at the scene? You question our professional opinions. Is this seriously why I had to come here? - But the details show... - Fuck the details! You opened an officially closed case without permission! You're just like your husband! I'll bet you have a conspiracy theory. Close your own case by tomorrow morning. And forget this case. Or start looking for a new job. The boss was pretty harsh with you. He's the new colleague on Homicide. He came from the countryside. He wants to talk to you about your cases. - I have to go now. - OK. Call me if you need any help. Where is it? Where is it? Fuck. Look, Éva, I'm only trying to help you. Following 90 days of non-payment, we have to auction off your apartment. So, you must pay your mortgage debt within 3 days. I hope you can manage, but please try at least. Kati is one of our most talented students, but she might lose her full scholarship with such bad behavior. Unfortunately. We begin disciplinary procedures tomorrow. You have to sign the report. - It's not nice to make rude comments. - They said my father... Whatever they say, you cannot break their nose. Marcella's father is the deputy mayor. I convinced him not to press charges. She suffered serious injuries. You don't need me to explain. It won't happen again, right? Kati, wait inside. We'll be right with you. Do you deal with speeding tickets? No. Do you know somebody who does? Never mind. This was Kati's last strike. Let's go in and sign the report. Where is it? Where is it? Demonstrations continue. The angry mob tried to block police intervention with barricades. Though the crowd broke up by dawn, demonstrations continue today. Here. They demand the prime minister's resignation. The leader of the opposition stated: He agrees with... Next time they pick on you, just ignore them. The disturbances ended in 44 injuries and 1 death. The 32 year-old... Did you hear me? You can't break everybody's nose. If you'd look a bit more normal, they'd pick on somebody else. I'm invisible and boring as it is... like you, and your toast sandwiches. That's not why they pick on me. They said... dad was corrupt and... killed himself. Why didn't you tell me? Why did I have to find out from my classmates? You think that's normal? Give me your pants. I'll wash them. Who cares about my pants? He killed himself, right? Why?! Why?! Say something! I hate that you're like this! He killed himself because he couldn't stand you either! Foul play: Ruled out. Investigation procedure initiation: None. Do you have your sandwich? Do you have your sandwich? Éva Batíz? Please, get in. You have to come with me. - Go on. - Bye. They say she's completely nuts. The oldest profession, five letters... She and her husband were the best detectives I knew. I wonder if she'll find something. Look, Richie... Winks... doesn't wink... winks... doesn't wink. - You're messing with me, right? - Uh-huh. Shit. I'd like you to look at the scene. Self-hanging. What's the matter? Just send me the photos. If you prove this was a murder, I'll check the three cases you talked about yesterday. I'm here with you. I'll help. I had the corpse removed, like you asked. Trust me. Just tell me what I missed. - Did you get this already? - Uh-huh... Hi. What's the first question you ask? Tell me. - Suicide note? - None. Next. What seems off here? There's work to be done, Éva. Come on. - Was this hers? - Yes. - I'm done. Bye. - Okay. - How did she climb up there? - Maybe asked somebody to help. This isn't proof yet. We got this far too. 267... 81cm... - The lady from the neck down? - I know! 164 centimeters. 45cm. That's 263 in all. We're missing 4cm. If she was on tiptoes, that covers it. - A lady with a cane? - That's still self-hanging. How heavy was she? 60kg? About that. Push it down, please. 40... that's 5cm more. Thanks. Now we're missing 9cm. They hung her on the gas pipe... put a toppled chair under her... But didn't count on the chair cushion denting. Bingo. You see, I need you... and your folder. The dog bit off his finger? No, that's a very old truncation. What makes you think it was murder? The gap between two zipper teeth is 6mm. The gap between two fang marks on the wound is 6.6cm. This is Feri's coat. The diameter of his button is 3cm. The gap between the fangs of the victim's dog is 4cm. This person was killed by a much larger dog. Okay, not bad. But we'd need to take the dog's bite sample. It got put to sleep already. And do you know how the other dog got into the locked house? Why don't the photos make you panic? These are just pictures. You can't get away with breaking my sister's nose. Just sayin'. She's even flat-chested. There are no clues. Let's work. We have no time to panic. There's no trace of forced entry. Look around. C'mon. Help. I've seen everything on the photos. Then look at what they didn't photograph. Where's the attic door? When did he die? 4 days ago. When we had that big storm. The killer got in here... let his dog in from the yard. The dog killed the old man, he put the dog outside, climbed out here, and they left together. I've seen this footprint before. What if these cases are connected? The boss will be really angry. I'm not angry! Through the roof? Goddamnit. Fucking hell! I need a team. What team?! There's no team here! The city's in ruins. 17 colleagues in the hospital... There'll be lots of overtime work too. You want to ruin my statistics? In an election year? I get my ass kicked enough from above! Now you bring 4 new homicide cases?! This is all your fault! No. It's mine. What if the press finds out? And if they find out we're covering up murders, and the cases are related? What makes you think that? Are you blackmailing me?! I just need three weeks. You get two weeks. If you don't find anything you go back to the countryside. Get out of here! I'll get you a desk in our office. Don't worry... just focus on your breathing. You know what? Count every breath you take. Count to ten. Then start again. Please don't. Okay. Just count. We'll be done soon. One... Left hand... ring finger... She could've been injured before they threw her out. Or while she was gardening. In the middle of the forehead... Count. One... And this? Two... What would it prove? She was knocked down and thrown out? Exactly. She fell on her back. This injury is not in the autopsy records. I don't believe it. Show me. Do you rule out that she was hit on the head and thrown out? - Answer me! - Six... Didn't you learn manners? - Answer me! - Seven... Yes, she might have been knocked down and thrown out. - Eight... - Are you happy now? Nine... Footage from security cameras. I think I'll be spending the night here. - Call logs, bank statements? - I've asked for them already. Witnesses? None. A lot of shoe brands have such soles. This isn't a clue we can follow right now. Shit! Professor? We can't rule out that it was the same perpetrator. Probably male. He tries to disguise the murders. May suffer from dissociative personality disorder. We'll protect the country... protect families... protect the future of our children. We need safety and unity in order to finally gain the advancement of our nation... He's unable to fit into society. Believes himself to be omnipotent, almighty. He imagines unlimited power, feels no empathy for anyone. Doesn't love, feels no anxiety, does not learn. This country is our home. Faith - trust - future. The National Union Party. The elderly victims might allude to him being raised outside a family. He projects his personal grievances onto the world. Creates ideology to go with his killings. Athletic, muscular. Feels like he has unlimited rights. A right to kill. He will continue until he is caught. Mom, I can't believe this. You sewed up my pants? I told you we knock before entering a room. - They ripped, so I sewed it. - But that's how I liked it! All the light switches in a row! Grilled cheese every night! Half an hour of TV per day, and not a word about Dad! That's how you want it! Cause those are your damned rules, right?! I've never even seen a picture of him... I threw them out. He left us and we don't talk about him. Nothing. No gunpowder traces. But a lot of rope marks. The head would've surely dropped to one side from the shot's impact. They arranged his head in a vertical position for some reason. Everything okay? Uh-huh... - Do you establish foul play? - This wasn't suicide. And they didn't try to disguise it either. Catch the bastard. Five... six... seven... eight... nine... ten... I want to know all the tiny details. Anything might be useful. Feri: Taxi companies, police, ambulance. - Was there anything odd last night? - OK. We must return to the earlier crime scenes. \"Betrayal of the intelligentsia.\" What the fuck is this?

It's common with psychopaths. - We found fingerprints on the papers... - which were not in our database. We have 5 victims so far, but 6 Points on his list. He might kill again.

I checked the victims' call logs. I found a number which called all of them. - I called it, but it didn't ring in there. - And? Now it's busy all the time. Nobody's stupid enough to call their victims from their own number. Maybe it's a public phone. I'll check this number. Look... Shit. C'mon, we'll catch him! Come on. Stop... Stop... Are you scared?

Quit wasting time! This is all you got, coppers! Motherfuckers! We won't give up, even if you lock us all up, so don't celebrate yourselves, cocksuckers! There's people who'll finish what I started.

Everything okay? - Who'll be the 6th? - What 6th, dickhead? 6 Points of Political Betrayal. Sound familiar? Ancient history. Why don't you ask about nursery school? So you admit to uploading the list on the net. Blow me. Never mind. It was uploaded from your computer, printed onto your paper. - What? - Your fingerprints are on the papers. - Who's the 6th victim? - Your mother. Why did you kill them? Why did they have to die? What the fuck? I didn't kill anybody. The DNA tests take a while. But I'm sure we'll have a match. We have plenty of evidence. We don't need your confession. But maybe it'll be easier for you. Go fuck your mothers, you bastards. You can't falsely accuse me. I didn't do anything. Understand? I didn't kill anybody! Motherfuckers! Something wrong? Fuck you! The address of the phone number's owner you asked for. - It's always busy... - Here are the victims' bank statements too. - Thanks. - Come on. We couldn't have done it without you. Attention please! I'm firing anybody who brings in a new case before the elections. I was told that Péter is promoted. Congrats, Major! - The first round's on you tonight! - Thanks. Thank you. Thanks so much! - Congratulations. - Richie... - Congratulations! - Thank you. Kati, you've got to eat something. You can't hide all night. It's not a toast sandwich this time. What is it then? It's a cold one. Thanks. What the fuck? Hey. What are you doing here? Honestly, it's a dream come true. A serial killer or a promotion? A partner like you. Does this pickup line work in the countryside? Sometimes it does... I see. You're the smartest cop I ever met. But there's a problem. What? Well... That you really are dangerous to me. I'm sorry about... But I like that. HOLDING CELL Don't. What's wrong? My daughter... Oh, for fuck's sake. He must've hid that fucking blade in his clothes. Yeah. Excuse me! Does Kálmán Horváth live here? I came to fix the garden just now. Mr. Horváth is abroad for 3 weeks. His phone is always busy. I can't let anyone in. But you have a key, don't you? Oh my God.

NATIONAL PENSION INSTITUTE Without a court order, I can only give you this archive. - Are you okay? - Uh-huh. Dezső Kovács, retired from Transimpex on June 24, 1989. Lilla Maros, Transimpex. Retired: June 24, 1989. Irén Koltai, Transimpex, June 24, 1989. Péter Magda, Transimpex. Kornél Németh, Transimpex... All the victims retired on June 24, 1989. Last place of employment: Transimpex. - Do you have files on Transimpex? - Uh-huh. - What kind of a company was it? - Some foreign trade company. As all the \"impex\" -es were. Excuse me, what does \"inactive\" mean? It just means they are dead. What happened to this person? Hmm, that's strange. He was erased from the system. Erased, like he'd never existed. Hello? Sándor Réczei? I am Lieutenant Éva Batíz, police department. I see... Could I meet him anyway? Sándor... Did your former colleague Kálmán Horváth call you? Tastes good. Good... You may be in danger. Your Transimpex colleagues are... dead. Transimpex... Good coffee... Give me coffee. Coffee! Give me coffee! Wicked girl! Give me coffee! Tibike! Tibi... Tibi... We solved the most brutal serial murder case of the decade. Let me introduce our newly appointed deputy head of the Homicide Department, Major Gács. Thank you. After we collected conclusive evidence, the suspect committed suicide in police custody. Can you confirm the political motive? We are not sure yet what motivated the murders. I wrote a summary of the case. So many things happened today. So... the murders were disguised as accidents or suicides. This was Plan A. Éva, it's over. It's all over. It's not over. We realized this, and then came Plan B. We were given the boy's notes on a platter, with fingerprints, then they killed him. Who would have done that? I don't know yet. All the victims worked in the same department at a trade firm in the '80s. - So what? - What if they wanted to hide this? What if they had to die because of this? Kálmán Horváth was among them. That really was an accident. Feri's writing the report. But he called all the victims for some reason. They were colleagues. Kept in touch. Pensioners' club or some shit. You want coffee? I don't drink coffee. Two of them died in the '90s. I met the ninth one recently. He's completely demented. The tenth... Demented, so he's fine. Just like the 10th I assume. Goddamn... This shit is broken. No. The 10th was wiped from all records. Maybe he knows what's going on. We must find him. We must continue investigating. You want me to look like an idiot? I just announced that we solved the case. Éva, let it go now. I'll get you a pay raise. You can solve your mortgage problem. Let's not ruin it, Éva. Don't ruin it. I've been here two weeks and already I've been promoted. You did all this to get promoted? Everybody involved in this case dies. Do you really believe that boy committed suicide - a few hours after arrest? - That's enough! It was suicide. The blade was in his pants. He was a psycho, for fuck's sake! Yes, maybe... Do you suspect someone? Me, perhaps? Or someone else? Who do you suspect? Do you hear what you're saying? I have to go now. You should go to room 205. They're waiting for you. NATIONAL POLICE HEADQUARTERS DEPUTY HEAD, HOMICIDE DEPT. PSYCHIATRIC COUNSELING Are you taking your meds? Look, your test results weren't too good. And Péter really did get in trouble because of you. You had your first panic attack after your husband's suicide... I liked Gábor too, you know... We talked about this a lot. We have to accept his death. That unsuccessful investigation, his alcohol problems, and he might have been afraid of becoming a father... He wanted a child more than anything. DEPARTMENT AGAINST ORGANIZED CRIME His head was positioned. As if looking at something. You need to take this medicine again. I've got a therapy group. Join us. It'll help you to realize that panic is just fear of being afraid. And you must finally face this trauma. I'm signing you off on sick leave. No. Please, don't. Don't do this. It's mandatory. Only a month, for now. You have to hand in your service weapon. Kati, look at me when I speak to you. - Sanyi, explain what happened. - It wasn't us. She's lying. Believe me. We'd never do such a thing. Ask our father. Did somebody see it? Can you prove it? If you did this to yourself to get them in trouble, you won't get away with it. \"Keeping political power through violence.\" Éva Batíz speaking. What? I told her to make peace. The investigation was dropped. We can't punish the deputy mayor's kids... Éva! Éva! Wait, Éva! WHAT'S THE POINT OF LIVING IF TRUTH IS DEAD Kati. Kati, come away from there. I hate you! You and this whole school! Kati. Kati. Kati. We'll leave this place forever. Just come away. What makes you think I won't jump? Suicides don't bring sandwiches with them. Come down before I punch someone too. Róza Fogarasi, hit by a car, M.L. March 22, 1982. Róza Fogarasi. Search. Evening News. Pasarét District Tragedy. A teaching assistant of the Sociology Dept.

István Kolos charged with several counts of homicide committed suicide in his cell Wednesday. The Budapest man was taken into custody 2 days ago, suspected of 4 counts of homicide. N.K. - Hi, Éva. - Feri. I found the connection. All the victims worked for an undercover death squad in the '80s. They died the way they once killed. Accident, suicide. Get it? Even the scapegoat killed in custody fits. Shit! Do you have access to the central archive? - I do, but it won't be easy. - You have to help. Your place in an hour. Come on. Let's go this way. WE WANT JUSTICE! WE WANT JUSTICE! POISON Calm down. I can't understand half of what you're saying. - Is this mine? - Oh-ho! - This is for kids. - Thanks. A... hamburger... The records were swept before the change of regime. They're not in the archives. If they really were a death squad, you won't find anything about them. I had the little notebook in my hand. It contained everything. The news was in the old papers. That woman took everything, along with my bag. I have no proof. Nothing... No evidence, no case. Wait. Don't you want this cheeseburger instead? No. You are such a terrible liar... Do you know what car a Fiat Lux is? Maybe made for the American market. What is it? Nothing. I still have this from the library. It has dots marked on it. Thank you. - Yes? - Sorry to bother you so late. I got your number from Kálmán Horváth. I see. Come to my office tomorrow at 2. Sárközi Law Office. 42 Andrássy Avenue. I need a password? My client gave strict orders to only give out the deposit to someone who knows the password. And so, madam, let's not waste each other's time anymore. Fiat Lux... Fiat Lux? Let there be light. Genesis 1:3. Rózsa Street Bank. A word of advice, though. Think it over well before you open the safe. You'll find old files in an envelope. Old Internal Affairs files. But be warned. The fact that my client is dead shows how serious this case is. Where's my daughter? Look, honey... You will give it to me... And I give you my word that you will not be harmed. Where did you hide that envelope? I don't believe you. I know who you are. Perhaps you suspect a few things... You might know a few details... But I doubt you know anything. You have no idea what this envelope is. Kálmán Horváth organized a meeting with the members of our old unit. Except one. His plan was to blackmail the 10th member of our unit with his past. Kálmán Horváth wanted to blackmail a man who'd made it to the top of the food chain. We couldn't get Kálmán to tell us where he hid that damned envelope with the evidence. You're the only one who knows where it is. Éva, I hope you don't mind me saying... that you, with your panic disorder... your mortgage issues... your whole pathetic life... you're not exactly a hero. Your husband... He was completely different. With his \"Petrol Case\" investigation. You can easily track down a lone hero... manipulate them... or if not, you can eliminate them. As in your husband's case. Who was it? Who did it? A freelancer. He works for me at the moment. But you will tell us where the envelope is. I'm sure of it. Hi, Mom. Hi, Kati. Your colleague who picked me up is really nice... we... You see? Your daughter is perfectly safe. And this won't change if we get the envelope. Promise that you won't hurt her. Of course I won't. On the contrary... We'll take care of her. Éva... You are sick... You need psychiatric care. You could be forced into treatment in a mental clinic. And your daughter will be taken from you. You can't do that. It won't be necessary... Right? Because, honey... you're just like anyone else in this city. You live your little lives... Pay off your debts... Vote every 4 years believing you have a say... Sometimes you get angry... go to demonstrations, you shout... feel powerful. And then what happens? A big nothing. And you finally accept it. We have no business with you. You can't prove anything. Tell me where the envelope is and you'll get your pathetic little life back, and your daughter. I'm asking for the last time. Where is it? On the ground floor. At the landing, on the little cabinet. Smart girl. My friends are going there now. If you've told the truth, you have just one thing left to do. Forget this ever happened. But I warn you: We're only allowed one mistake here. The first... and the last. STATUE OF LIBERTY Fucking suicides. Making more paperwork for us. CANDIDATE FOR PRIME MINISTER ARRESTED KOVÁCS THE TERMINATOR - Hello, I'd like a Daily News. - 255 forints please... Please, help yourself. CANDIDATE FOR PRIME MINISTER ARRESTED VOTE FOR ME! VOTE FOR ME! Ernő Kovács. Thank you. Are you in a hurry? You need a ride? 4PM. The News. - Shall I turn it off? - No, leave it. Ernő Kovács, candidate for Prime Minister for the upcoming elections was arrested yesterday. Reports made by Ernő Kovács, leader of the former Secret Service \"Death Squad\", reveal horrible murders committed in the 1980s. There's no information yet about how these files became public. He was right. I'm not a lone hero. I'm just like anyone else in this city, doing their job. SECRET SERVICE REPORT Paying off their debts... TO THE DAILY NEWS sometimes going to demonstrations... to shout... and then nothing happens. Think it over well before you open the safe. You'll find old files in an envelope. Old Secret Service files. - Can I photocopy these quickly? - Yes. May I rent the safe for a few more weeks? Since then I've lived in terror. But it was worth it. Because at that moment, it felt good not to be afraid... - Thanks for the lift. - No problem. ARCHIVES Thank you. - Everything alright? - Yes. József Gábor Batíz July 10, 2003. Autopsy report. Foul play: Ruled out. Investigation initiation: None. Report signed by Police Officer Ferenc Sóskuti. - Your mom? - She's in the archive. She is so nervous. Gone to look at something she's been avoiding for 14 years. No evidence, no case. No evidence, no case. Are you alright? Where's Kati? Feri's up on the roof for a smoke. She's with him. You are such a terrible liar... Is that the Basilica there? Yes, the Basilica. Look for Liberty Bridge... You know what it's famous for? Hi! Did you find anything? No. And we're leaving now.

These type of pictures turn regular folks into stars. We're gonna do it all ourselves. - Ain't that right, RJ? - Yes, sir. Finally, a level playing field for people like us. I don't know, Wayne. Sounds an awful lot like what you said about The Topless Carwash. You remember that? Yeah. And had the IRS not had a goddamn personal vendetta against me, that would've panned out beautifully. Uh-huh. Well, you know I'm always game. My American Dream is not unreasonable. I just want a paid-for house with a big ole pool, so I can float around with my knees in the breeze and tan these titties. What? I was dealt a good hand. People spend a lot of money to look at what God gave me. Be a sin not to take care of 'em. Mmm. Yes, it sure would. What about you, Maxine? What's your American Dream? Hmm. Hurry it up, we aren't gonna be long in there. If this kid I picked up from the university can put it together like he says, our days of struggling may soon be over. We do even half the numbers of Debbie Does Dallas, I'm outta the red for good. Hell, let's make a picture a week, then. Patience, darlin'. I've been being patient my whole life. Well, that's the thing about being patient. - I need to be famous, Wayne. - Mmm-hmm. I'm ready for the high life. I'm sick and tired of never gettin' what I want. Well, you help me keep those jokers in line out there, I'll make sure you get everything your heart desires. You better have. I don't wanna worry no more, Wayne. I deserve nice things. I have cosmopolitan taste. - Don't I know it. - I mean it. I want the whole world to know my name. Like Lynda Carter or some shit. Hey, everyone with a pulse is gonna lust after a piece of Maxine Minx once they see what you can do. You know why? Why? 'Cause you got that X factor. Fuckin'-A-right. Now, mosey on over there and grab us some Wonder Bread, Wonder Woman. I don't like his girlfriend. You don't like anybody's girlfriend. She hardly says a word. She just stares at everyone. Well, she's shy. Probably ain't never seen nobody like us before. People who stare give me the heebie-jeebies. Better get used to that if you're gonna be in the movies. Your little boyfriend is cute. You help him with all his films? Sometimes, yeah. Is that your boyfriend? Sometimes, yeah. Hey, how come you don't gotta film none of this in order? Well, once I have it all in the can, I can rearrange it however I want. No shit. I actually intend on experimenting a lot with the film's editing. Giving it a certain sense of the avant-garde, like they're doing in France. It's classier that way. And it's a good trick to disguise the low budget. All right, let's slate it. And hit it. All right, go ahead and fill her up. You know, if you tilt the camera up from the nozzle... ...it'll look like he's using his cock. See? I got good sense, too. How come we couldn't do any of this filming in Houston? Ain't they got plenty of farms? Well, this county raised property taxes, a little bit of cash goes a long way out here. Most older folks can't compete with the bigger outfits no more. Now, we're not the only ones trying to make a buck. Kidnappers, murderers, sex fiends... All the result of our increasingly secular society... Besides, it ain't exactly something I wanna advertise around town. You know how some people can get when it comes to sex. Remember what happened in Sodom and Gomorrah. - Get what we needed? - Oh, I got it. Thanks to help from yours truly. - Got my smokes? - Yes. God damn. I'm just askin'. Hey, if I'm gonna be having sex for you, I'm gonna need cigarettes. How's the script? I don't know. It's all right. Does it matter? Hey, I don't wanna have to wear a hard hat to make a livin', do you? No. Then don't you be bringin' down the vibe of my investments. Negativity attracts negative results. Winstons? You know I only smoke Old Golds. All they had, Bobby-Lynne. That's it. I'm calling my agent. Just get back in the dang van. Mmm-mmm! That's right. The deviants are already amongst us, waiting for our sons and daughters. So, heed dire warnings, and repent before it is too late. He may be a forgiving God, but every man has got his limits. Must be a bad wreck. Y'all stay safe out there. I'll be right back with some more golden oldies right after this commercial break. 93.5, KBQB. ...the 60th anniversary ...take place this Saturday. Don't miss your chance to tour the entire state... - What is it? - Oh, don't look. I hate blood and guts. Just when you thought you'd escaped the slaughterhouse. Yeah. Now, that's a bonanza... Was that the... This is it. Our own studio backlot. Thank goodness. I'm horny. - You're always horny. - No, not always. It's perfect. It's really gonna add a lot of production value. Y'all stay put while I go and handle business right quick. This wasn't I had in mind when I agreed to help out on your film. Gotta start somewhere, Lorraine. RJ, it's smut. When did you become such a prude? I'm not. I just don't understand why you're doing all this. Because it is possible to make a good dirty movie. Who's that? Yes, sir. It's Wayne Galleroy. We spoke on the telephone. Uh... Howard, right? You from the county? This here's private property. Didn't you see the signs down at the end of the drive? Oh, easy, partner. Somethin's wrong. What'chu talkin' 'bout? You're trespassing. The law says I can shoot. Sir, I ain't from the county. I'm from Houston. We spoke on Tuesday. You remember? About y'all's boarding house. Oh, that's right. You're looking for a place to stay. Well, you never can be too careful with strangers. You had me pretty nervous there. It ain't even loaded. Most of the times, just wavin' it around is all it takes. Oh, yes, sir. I keep the same thing in my glove box. Wow, that's one ugly sumbitch. What? He is. Hell of a spread you got here. We like it. You all right there, old-timer? I'm fine. - She ain't much. - She's gorgeous. Building was for soldiers during the Civil War. They never saw any action though. What about you? You serve? Flat feet. I did. Two tours in South Vietnam. Had enough farmers tryin' to shoot me for one lifetime. Know what I mean, Pops? Oorah. Oh, careful, Howie. Hot damn, that's my future fiancee you're eyeballin' there. Been a while since you seen anythin' that nice? I don't recall you mentioning you'd bringing all these others. Now, about that... See, your ad said $30, but... I threw in a little extra to sweeten the deal. I hope that's okay. I don't think I like you, Wayne. In fact, I don't much like the looks of none of y'all. Now, my wife is next door, so I would appreciate a little discretion. I give you my word. You won't even know we're here. That was some stellar negotiating. You really do have a knack for business. You keep jawin', towhead, I'll pull you off the main stage for a month. Oh, but then, honey, you won't make no money neither. How could you just stand there and let him talk about us like that? Oh, calm down. Ain't no need to harsh the mellow. It's harmless. He's just old. His pecker ain't probably been hard since before you were born. I'd hate people like us then, too. He don't know what we're doing, does he? So, church mouse, you do speak. No. He sure doesn't. And I intend to keep it that way. Now, I don't wanna give the old codger a heart attack. Would you? It's better to beg for forgiveness than ask for permission. You know what I mean? All right. That's enough jabberin'. I reckon it's about high time we cut to the chase and we give the people what they wanna see. What do you say? Fucking finally! Okay. Now... Now flip her over. Ooh! Oh, yeah. Fuck me. - Yeah. - Fuck. That's great. Just scooch your chin up for me. All right, now slow it all down. - I wanna see the passion. - Hey, kid. How about you just point the camera and stay in your lane. Let me do the screwing here. Yeah! Yes! Oh, my God. Now, I may not know shit from Shinola when it comes to filmmaking, but I know for damn sure people are gonna wanna see what I just saw in there. Well, that's 'cause I'm not treatin' it like pornography, but as cinema. That's what these other adult films are lackin'. Whatever you're doin', you keep doin' it. People's eyes are gonna pop out of their damn skulls when they see this. We're gonna be rich. Feel how hard my cock is. Oh, sorry, baby. Don't be standing there like you're all proud of yourself. I was born for this line of work. Uh. You didn't do nothin', dummy. It's called actin'. You good, but you ain't that good. Fuck my pussy. Oh, you make me so wet. Oh, my God, you're so big. Aw, don't look so glum. You did just fine. Come here. I think I love you. Bless your heart. And action! Sorry to bother you, ma'am, but my van broke down on the highway back yonder, and I was hopin' I could use y'all's phone to call for help. Oh, my goodness. I'm afraid we don't own a telephone, but my daddy will be home soon, and I'm sure he could give you a lift to town. Would you like to come inside? Much obliged. Hello? Hello? Lemonade? Sure is hot out there. You must be awful thirsty. Yes, ma'am. It's got a good taste. I should probably get back now. My boyfriend gets real fussy when he don't know where I'm at, so... Come with me before Daddy gets home. I was young once, too. It was taken right before the first war. Believe it or not, my Howard served in both. He survived the trenches and Omaha Beach. There wasn't anything he wouldn't do for me back then. That's the power of beauty. I was a dancer in those early years. But then the war came, so... Not everything in life turns out how you expect. Such a special face. Beautiful. Look. I don't know what's come over me. I've never quite felt like this before. If Daddy catches us, there's no telling what he might do. What are you doing? You should go. It will be our secret. What will? Shh. Watch out! I've been looking everywhere for you! Sorry. The kid says we're gonna lose the light! Well, come on now, chop-chop. You're not good. Bluff it. You're a fucking sex symbol. I will not accept a life I do not deserve. Are you ready? Let's go to work. Coast is clear. - Right... - Sound speed. Okay, we're rollin'. Farmer's Daughter, take one. Action. I'm looking for the owner of this farm. His daughter said I could find him in here. You must have been talking to my sister. Sister? - She didn't mention you. - Not surprised. She's always been jealous. I'm younger, get all the attention. Daddy never lets her leave the farm anymore. He's very protective. Well, I was hopin' he could give me a ride back to town before it got dark. We shouldn't disturb him. It would only make him angry. You wouldn't like Daddy when he's angry. I could give you a ride. We talked about this. Howard? Please. You know I can't. My heart... ♪ They're gonna put me in the movies ♪ They're gonna make a big star out of me ♪ They'll make a film about a girl ♪ Who's sad and lonely ♪ And all I gotta do is act naturally ♪ You were amazing out there. Now I know why Wayne left his wife for you. So do I. Careful. Told y'all she was somethin' special. X factor. Thanks, baby. What are you looking at? Wait, come on now. No, Wayne. Anybody ever teach you not to stare? It's rude. You got somethin' to say to me or what? No. Well, I do have a question. See, she's interested, is all. What's on your mind, church mouse? Isn't it strange watching her doin' it with him? It's just business. As long as the camera is runnin'. So the camera changes things? That's right. It's not real life, Raine. It's just a movie. I know that. Just sayin'. What about love? What about love? Well, don't y'all believe in it? Of course we believe in love. How can you love someone and still be with other people? You think we don't have no morals or somethin', is that it? No. No, I just... Take it from me, letting outdated traditions control how you live your life will get you nowhere. I don't know about you, but I got better places to be than where I came from. Amen to that. And besides, it's just sex. You can decide who you wanna love, but not who you wanna screw. Attraction's out of our control. It ain't healthy keeping those feelings locked away inside. I seen you sneaking a few long peeks at Jackson over here. - No, I... I wasn't looking... - It's okay. He don't mind none. She's right. I don't mind. No offense. Everybody likes sex. It's a gas. We're just not afraid to admit it. Queer, straight, Black, white... It's all disco. You know why? Because one day, we're gonna be too old to fuck. And life's too short, if you ask me. Roger that. The fact of the truth of the matter is, we turn folks on. - And that scares 'em. - They can't look away neither. That's right. We're like a foxy car wreck. Which is how I know that this new home video market is set to explode. Finally, people are gonna get to see what they desire in the privacy of their own homes, free of judgment. We're gonna give that to them before anyone else. Porn ain't only gonna be - for perverts no more. - Aw. Toast to the perverts. They've been payin' our bills for years. Hear, hear! To the perverts! To livin' a life of excess, being young and having fun till the day we die. To the power of independent cinema. To living life on our own terms. And never accepting what self-righteous naysayers have to say. Right on. I don't know if I agree with all of that, but I did like what I saw today. I didn't think I would, but I did.

I've been thinking about it all day. And... Well, I'm young. And if we really are makin' a good dirty movie, then I don't wanna just carry the equipment. I wanna be in it. Well, you can't. Says who? It's my film, Lorraine. I mean, it wouldn't make any sense. We've already shot half of it. The story can't just suddenly change midway through. Why? Because it just isn't done. What about in Psycho? You love that movie. Well, Psycho is a horror film. And that plot was a MacGuffin to build suspense. And I'm not making that kind of movie. Oh, come on, RJ. Nobody's comin' to see this film for the plot. They're comin' to see tits and ass. - And a big dick. - Lorraine! It's the truth. Why not just give the people what they're payin' for? Because I'm making something better than that. When did you become such a prude? All right, hold on. I am the executive producer, which means I get a word. So, why don't we just take a step outside before anythin' gets said that someone might regret. You gotta back me up in here, Wayne! I mean, this situation is fixin' to get outta control. It is awfully close. Relax. Hey, what is it they say, \"Life imitates art\"? It's the other way around. Whatever, it don't matter. But you need to listen to me, okay? Because you ain't been 42, and I have been 23. And I'm gonna explain somethin' to you about young women. Now, if she's serious, which I suspect she is, she's gonna do it whether you like it or not. Now, you try to stop her, not only is she gonna do it, she's gonna go on and do it with God knows how many people in God knows how many other films, and nobody wants that. The way I see it, you only got one good option here. What, letting her get balled by some man whore? Come on now, Jackson is a professional. He ain't got no diseases or nothin'. You just want more sex in the movie. That ain't me, hoss. She wants it, you heard her. Heck, if she does great, she gets famous, maybe she'll take you with her. Wayne, you don't get it. Lorraine is not like the others in there. She is a nice girl. I beg your pardon? No, I didn't mean it like that. Oh, I hate to be the one to tell you this, but ain't none of them nice girls. To hell with this. She can have it. Let's see how far they get without me. Good luck finding your own way out of here. What the... Ma'am? Are you all right? Sorry, I'm... Ma'am? What? How come you just did that? Why won't you look at me? Look at me like you looked at her. What? I can show you what I'm capable of. Stop. I don't wanna see it.

Oh, hey, it ain't like your dog ran off. He's probably just processin' things, you know? Go on back to bed. I feel bad if I hurt him. I don't wanna break up. Hun, you didn't do nothin' wrong. He'll get over it. He just needs to toughen up, is all. Come on. I'll talk to him in the morning. Will you help me find him? Please? I'm worried. All right. I ain't gettin' in the middle of no more of this shit. RJ! Are you in here, brother? This ain't the way to go about handlin' this. Oh, no. I'm sorry if I disturbed you. What are you doin' out here? I'm lookin' for my boyfriend. Have you seen my wife? No, sir. Two keys to keepin' a healthy relationship. Never let a good woman out of your sight. Never mention her weight. How do you think I've been surrounded by so many beautiful females my whole life? There's an art to it. Just like business. Fuck! Son of a bitch! Oh, fuck me! Oh, shut up, cheeseburger! Go wander into traffic. Oh, fuck. RJ, you in here? I stepped on a nail. Come on out and help me, for Christ's sake! I'm gonna catch tetanus from this shit. RJ? Church mouse, that you? There's another light down in the cellar. Can you go get it? Please. My wife is not well. It's very dark, and I'm worried she could fall and break her hip. Downstairs. You'll see my workbench. Found it! Hey, I'm locked in! Hey! Hey! Hey! Open up! What is it, baby? Thought I heard somethin'. Probably nothin'. Old habits die hard. Go back to sleep. Aye, aye, captain. Everything okay, Pops? My wife, she's gone missing. Missin'? She gets confused. It happens sometimes after dark. Lot of firepower for a missin' wife. It's for gators. I found her once by the edge of our pond. If she was to fall in... Want some help? Not for self but for country, right? Let me go and get my skivvies. I say we each take a side of the perimeter. Cover ground quicker that way. I only got the one light. No offense, but it's been a while since you was deployed. I spent three nights face down in a rice paddy scanning for land mines and trip wires. Once a marine, always a marine. If she's out here... I'll find her. I got nothin', Pops. Shit. What you doing all the way in there? Oh, no. Pops, you okay? You in here? Help! Help, somebody, please! Please help me! RJ! Help! Oh, shit! You scared me, Pops. Once a marine, always a marine. Well... Your lady ain't in there. I can't give her what she wants anymore. You don't understand what it's like. You can still do as you please. Say what? The last bohemian that stayed here was the same. Traipsin' around in barely any clothes. Enticin' my wife. Yeah... Okay, well, we better get back up to the house and find out what's goin' on. I know exactly what's goin' on. Maxine? That woman was in my bed touching me! You're just makin' things worse. Help me! Somebody! Please! Nobody is comin' for ya. Get back down in that cellar and be quiet! - Shut up! - Help! - Hey! Somebody, please! - Kidnappers, murderers, sex fiends, lurkin' where we least expect... Help! - Somebody, help! - ...in good Christian homes, right under our very noses! Jackson? Wayne? Where are y'all? Oh, my goodness. Ma'am? Ma'am? Be careful! Step away from the edge, it's dangerous. It's all right. Here, here. You're safe now, okay? Are you hurt? I don't see anything. My nana gets confused sometimes as well. I learned all about it. Believe it or not, I've even thought about becomin' a nurse one day. So... Okay. Why don't you come with... Oh! What the hell did you do that for? I don't need a nurse. Why should you get to have it all? What have you ever done except be a whore? Okay, you know what? You don't want my help? No problem. I was just tryin' to be nice. You don't deserve to be able to just flaunt it in my face like you do. It ain't my fault you didn't live the life you wanted. Now move out of the way, please. Move! You mean old ugly b... Bitch. Was that the one? You know I don't like blondes. Disgustin'. Lorraine? RJ? Uh, place is empty. What about that other fella, Wayne? In the barn. Stuck like the pig he was. Well, that's three down. Four. And I got another kept up at the house for you. I don't want her. This one was different. She had something special. Like I did. Sick and tired of never gettin' what I want. You know I want to give it to you, Pearl. But I'm tired, too. I know. Tell me I'm special. Of course you are. I've felt that way since the first moment we met. You were the most beautiful woman I'd ever seen. Oh, not anymore. Always. Tell me I'm yours. That you still want me. Make me feel young again. What if my heart can't take it? It can. Fuck me, Howard. Fuck me. Fuck me. Help! Help! Somebody, help me, please! Let me out of here! Keep your voice down. Don't tell me to be quiet! I was locked in a dungeon down there! These old people are fucking crazy! I have to get out of this house before they kill me, too. We need to find the keys to their truck. I never should have listened to you. This is all your fault! Lorraine, we need to stick together. I hate you! I hate you all so much! Lorraine! I told her to stay in the damn cellar! That's all right. We don't need her anymore. We got each other again. Help me drag the body inside. If she's in the house, that's self-defense. That's the law. You don't really believe anyone's gonna come looking for 'em, do you? We ain't gonna risk it. We need to play this smart, Pearl. No sense in making a mess now. If nobody shows up by tomorrow, we'll take the body and we'll dump her in the pond with the others. Which reminds me, we're gonna need to get Wayne outta the barn and sink him, too. She's heavier than she looks. Howard. Howard! Howard? Howard? Howard! Where are the keys to the truck? - He's having a heart attack. - I don't give a shit! - Where are the fucking keys? - Well, now... - In the kitchen... - ...here we all are... - ...under the lamp. - ...together. Howard? We have reached a crossroad. With salvation... - Howard? - ...or damnation? You're gonna rot when people find out what you've done. The time is now. - What I have done? - For if we do not take control - of our own fate, the Lord... - What about you? ...shall do it for us. You don't think I know who you really are? I saw what you did in the barn. You're a deviant little whore. We're the same. You'll end up just like me. Time to turn our backs on sin and make the commitment... I'm nothin' like you. ...once and for all. You're a kidnappin', murderin' sex fiend. I'm a fucking star! The whole world is gonna know my name. I want to hear you all. Say it with me now. I will not accept a life - I do not deserve. - I will not accept a life I do not deserve. Hallelujah! Stop fuckin' starin' at me! Now, that's what I call divine intervention! The Lord smiles on those who accept Him. Praise his name! Glory be to Jesus! My hip... Help. Shh! You whore! You're not innocent! You're not special! It'll all be taken from you! Just like it was from me! I'll tell everyone what you are! It'll be our secret. Divine intervention. Praise the fuckin' Lord. I hope that, through my own admission, others may find the light. I wanna show y'all somethin'. Get a shot of this. There she is. My beautiful little daughter Maxine. Lured into a life of sin by the very deviants we warn of here on a daily basis. From our lovin' home into the hands of devils. We pray, one day, she'll find her way home to us. Amen. Bless you, bless you. What do you reckon happened, Sheriff? How the hell should I know?

Ah! Well done lad. All right, back to your place, Corporal Webb. Well, I think we'll call it a day, Sergeant. Sir. Sir. Yes, Lansing, what is it? Please, sir. I haven't had a turn yet. That's right, Lansing. You haven't, have you? I think I should, sir. All right. \n \n \n \n    (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n \n Bury it again, Sergeant. All right!

We'll be the last platoon at the cookhouse again. The food's bad enough when it's warm. I'll give him, \"Haven't had a go yet.\" All ready, sir! Call him on! Well, you men should have a pretty good idea how to use a Geiger counter by now. \n \n \n \n    (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n \n Remember what you've learned here today. It could save your life. And one other thing... You've been practicing with a piece of harmless radioactive material. If it ever comes to the real thing, the radioactivity won't be harmless... it will be extremely lethal. So find it, mark it... and get out of the way quickly. Leave it to be dealt with by those that know how. Right?! That's got it. When Lansing's done his bit, we'll call it a day. - Oh blimey, look at jet moving. - He'll take a week to find it. Not if I can help it, he won't. Shouldn't take long, sir. - I think he's found it. - Oh, don't be so sure, he couldn't find the nose on his stupid face. There... what did I tell you? - Lansing... what is it?! - I'm getting a very good reading, sir. Give me the counter. - Sergeant, fetch Major Cartwright! - Right, sir. I knew it. We'll be out here all night. Aye, aye, talk of the devil. Bannerman wants to speak to you, sir. - Oh good, what is it? - Over this ridge, sir. Mr. Bannerman? I was just coming over to see you, Bannerman. Why haven't you got your men moving yet? There was all the transport back to camp. There's something wrong here, sir. We're getting a reading on the counter where there shouldn't be one. - Oh. - It's ah... strongest about here. - Where have you got your stuff buried? - Over there, sir, by the tree. - All right, let's have a look. - Lansing!... Mark this spot with my stick, will you. - Very good, sir. - Hang on here. - Come on, Sergeant, where'd he put it? - Somewhere around here, sir. Try the counter, Mr. Bannerman. - Haggis, do you know what? - No, what? It's uranium, that's what it is. It's a bloomin' uranium mine. I wonder if we'll get a chance to stake a claim? No, not if the army get their hooks into it. Sir? There's something happening over here, sir. Look, just a minute, Lansing! Sir! - See to it, Sergeant. - Right, sir! You see, sir, the reaction couldn't possibly be because... What on earth's that? I don't know, sir. It sounds like thunder. Sergeant, get these men dispersed! Quickly! Right! You men, you heard what he said! Come along, all of you! Come on, jump to it! Come along, come along, men! Lansing! Go and get that man. He's got cloth ears. Come on, now! Move up there! Come on, Lance. Lansing, come out of there. Lansing! Attention, please, attention please, will Dr. Adam Royston... ...report to the Director's office immediately. Attention, please, attention please... ...will Dr. Adam Royston report to the Director's office immediately. Cobalt, container 19. Start your readings. 2,1,1, point 5. Doctor Royston, report to the director's office immediately. Doctor Royston, report to the director's office immediately. Sounds like your Pa is after Dr. Royston's blood. He'll be after mine if he catches me doing this. Open it. It's best to be the office type... administration. Peter... just a moment. - Where's Dr. Royston? - He asked me to stand by, sir. So I see. He's in his workshop, it's all right, this is purely routine. Maybe it is, but that's no reason for you to be doing his work for him. Master data coming up. Cobalt, container 20, start reading. What is Dr. Royston doing in that lab of his? Just an experiment. One of his own. Safe to come in, sir? Safe to come in, sir? Oh, it's you, Russell, come on in. Stay behind the screen, it's all radioactive. Your radio needs fixing, sir. Your radio, needs fixing, it shouldn't make a noise like that. Radiation... The day I can cut the racket in the radio without... ...putting that stuff back in there, then... then, that'll be clever. Now, what was it you wanted to see me about? The director wants you up at the establishment, sir. - Oh, no. - Well, you got a car out here? - No, sir, I came by bike. All right, I'll walk, I need a little exercise anyway. Said it was urgent, sir. Seemed a bit cross you might say. Yes, I'm sure he did. Tell him I'll run all the way. I don't care what you say, Adam. I am in charge here. And I shall decide what you will do and what you will not do. While we're on the subject, I do wish you wouldn't waste Peter's time. You mean I should be wasting my own time? That is not the point. Peter's job here is administration Oh, I know, he want's to be a scientist, but, that's no reason for you to encourage him. He has a great future in front of him. You must allow me to decide what's best for him. Oh, I'm sorry, John, I didn't think for a minute... I know you didn't, Adam, that's just the trouble. Well, let's see it doesn't happen again, eh. Oh, by the way, the army has phoned it. It appears they've picked up some radiation reaction. I'd like you to go and have a look at it. What? I've been working on a project. - Couldn't you possibly send somebody else? - I'm afraid not, Adam. Have a car out in front in 5 minutes for Dr. Royston. - May I see those solders now? - Of course. There's no radioactivity there now, there's... You're quite sure there couldn't possibly have been some mistake? Wait to you see those men, there's no mistake about them. Back, back... whoa! Mr. Bannerman? Just a moment, please? This chap was nearest the explosion. We thought he was just a bit shaken up at first. Then these burns started breaking out. - Not very pretty is it? - No it isn't. Thank you, boys. - What about the other fella? - He's over here. He went back to fetch that one. He wasn't quite so near the explosion. Let's have a look at your back, old chap. What do you make of that, hey? Were you carrying this when the explosion happened? Yes, sir. Excuse me. - OK, Sergeant. - All right, sir. All right, sir? - Have you finished? - Yes, thank you. - All right, carry on, Sergeant. - Come along, old chap. Major, I'd like to get some... ...further equipment out here. I wonder now if there's any way that that you can get a message back to my office? Yes, I'll take care of it, I'll send it over the air to HQ. - They'll phone it through from there. - Good. Poor old Lance is in a terrible state. Did you see it? Horrible. I saw a man once, fell up against a furnace door, looked just about the same. - He's passed over the nu. - Passed over the what? Died, screened all night he did. Hey, do you mind, I'm just going to have my tea. Tea, we'll not be back in time for breakfast. - Swing that light off. - If it was so sudden, Major... How did you have time to disperse...? - Major, you didn't answer my question. Do you think it is atomic? - Well, there certainly was radioactivity. - What are they trying to do now? I think they're trying to sound the pit. If there was radiation, how do you account for the absence of it now? - I don't know. - What about those burned men? They've been taken to the hospital. Military or civil? - Military. - This one that died, who was he? - His name was Lansing. - A National Serviceman? - Yes. Is there anything in the fact that the only one who died was a National Servicemen? Good heavens man, he was nearest the explosions! - Sir? - Yes, Sergeant, what is it? - Dr. Royston wants to see you, sir. - Aye, and we'd like to see Dr. Royston. I'm sorry gentlemen, I told you once before, no unauthorized person is allowed to approach. What right do you have....? Listen to me! You are on War Department property. I am in charge. Either you do as I say or I shall have you escorted from here. Do you know who...? Gentlemen, please! - Dr. Royston's over by the equipment, sir. - Thank you, Sergeant. Good night, gentlemen. I'm fair starved. Did you hear the sergeant tell those newspaper fella's off a strip. It's all right for him, he's had something to eat. What's the matter with you, have you got worms? - You're quite certain about that? - Yes, sir. I'm getting quite a number of readings off the sides, but I don't think there can be any doubt. - You want me, Royston? - Oh, Major, yes. There's nothing more we can do out here, I suggest that you leave a couple of men on guard, even if it's only to keep people from stepping over the edge. No point in keeping men out here all night. I'll have the area roped off and put up a couple of \"Keep Off\" notices. Kiddo, you get things wrapped up, and I'll wait for you in the car. What is it anyway? Have you found out how deep it is? How deep? No, we haven't. Do you mean to tell me this thing might be bottomless? I mean the operative range of this equipment is limited. - Good night, Major. - Good night, sir. How deep do you think that fissure really is, sir? I don't know. Now, the Major was going on about it being bottomless, you seem to have told him. Did I? That was very unscientific of me. We know it must have a bottom somewhere, whatever caused that split had to have a beginning. Had to have an end too. Well, surely the forces causing these surface splits just disperse. Forces causing surface spits don't burn a man to death by radiation. What are you getting at, sir? Peter, I'm not getting at anything, I just don't know. But, for the time being, let's assume that you're right. Let's not conjure up visions of nameless horrors creeping around in the night. It's all clear. - They'll kill me when I get home. - It's on mine. But we swore, and we can not break a swear. Repeat the oath. I swear to get into the tower, and look to see if old Tom sleeps there every night. - Are you scared? - No. How will ya then? Let's get it over. - You'll wait here? - I'll wait for 5 minutes. Three minutes! Good luck, Willie. Go on! Make haste, Willie. What was it, Willie? What did you see? Willie, wait for me! Willie, wait! Wait up, Willie! Don't leave me! Willie, wait! Wait! - What rate, Doctor? - Sixty drops a minute. Well? First degree radiation burns, Kelly. I thought so, that's why I called you in. Kelly, when did he come in? About an hour ago. Perhaps you better see the parents, they're outside. - Replaced the dressings, nurse, will you? - Yes, Doctor. What's wrong with him, Doctor? What is it? Is there anything you can tell us, Doctor? Well, I'm afraid it's a little early yet, to... Your son has been badly burned. - If you could tell us how or... - Burned, burned by what? That's what we're trying to find out. When did you first notice anything? - It was this morning. - I went into his room to wake him up. He was lying there with those horrible marks all over him. Well, yesterday, what happened yesterday? - Where did he go, do you know? - We don't know. He stopped out late with a friend of his, Ian Osborne. Ask him. He'll be able to tell you where they were last night. Oh, Ian, just a moment. Somebody wants to meet you, Ian. Ian... this is Dr. Royston. - Dr. Royston, this is Ian Osborn. - How are you, Ian? Thank you. Let's sit down, Ian. Now, I've just come from visiting your friend, Willie Harding. He's not very well, Ian. What's wrong with him? Well, you know, you and he were out late last night, weren't you? And something must have happened to him where you were. I'd like you to tell me what it was. Where did you go, Ian? Where was it, Ian? I can not tell you. We swore an oath. Willie is sick. He's very sick, Ian. I can't, I can't, we swore an oath. Yes, yes, but that was when Willie was fit and healthy, wasn't it? Wasn't it? Now that he's sick, see, that's different, he'd want you to tell. Are you sure? I'm very sure. Well, we went out to the tower in the marshes. It was awfully creepy. I dared Willie to go to the tower. Hello, anybody there? Mister. Wake up, mister! What is it... what, what, what is it? Oh! Look at the waste. - You care for a dram? - No, no thank you. - I came out here because... - Oh, come on man, have a dram. That container, that's mine, it came from my workshop. Where did you get it? - This? I found it lying about... - Don't touch it! Here man, mind what you're up to! Stay away from that! You touch it, and it may kill you. Come in. - Good evening, sir. - Hello, Peter. I can see what you meant on the phone. - Is it safe? - Unfortunately, yes. - This is lead, isn't it? - Half an inch thick. There's a sort of... I know, I found the same thing up at the tower. There's a towel there. You won't be able to wipe it off, Peter. It'll just disappear in an hour or two. What is it? Well, whatever it is, it's all over the place. How do you explain it, sir? All this extraordinary damage just to steal on old sample container. Do you know what's in that container, Peter? It's Tritium. Don't be alarmed now, it's completely harmless. And how long would you say Tritium retains its radioactivity? It's not a very stable compound, about 30 years. 28 actually, now take a radiation reading. No, the counters working all right, here, look. Just the luminous paint on my watch. What happened, sir? I don't understand. Peter, I'm afraid I don't either. Yesterday the material on that container was giving a danger point radiation reading. - Now as you just saw, it's nothing. - But that's impossible! Isn't it? Yesterday I would have said yes, but this fact is inescapable. The energy trapped in that Tritium has been sucked right out of it. And furthermore, these windows were barred and that door was locked all night. So, whoever it was came in here must be... most unusual. - Really, Inspector McGill. - Tristen. I'm sorry, but the whole thing's quite ridiculous. I never thought anyone would call you people in on this. The local police called us. As you know, sir, any crime, however small, connected with this establishment, automatically comes through to us. Quite possibly, but this crime, if you can call it that, has nothing to do with the establishment. This tin can was stole from Dr. Royston's own workshop, it's purely a personal matter. I should have thought the local police were well able to take care of that. As for the story of Dr. Royston's about the tin containing some... ...radioactive material. Well, I've spoke to the doctor about that, and I don't want to hear anymore about the matter, thank you. Well, I do, sir. So, perhaps you can tell me where I can find Dr. Royston. Obviously, Inspector... ...Mr. McGill... If you place any credence in this story, you don't know the first thing about the basic facts of science. - Now, let me... - Dr. Royston does. - Does what? - Know about the basic fact of science. Look here, sir, I've been sent up here to... ...pursue an investigation. Perhaps you'll allow me to do just that. Where can I find Dr. Royston? Don't you chaps even stop to eat? My name's McGill, do you mind if I sit down? United Kingdom, Atomic Energy Commission, Internal Security Police. Sounds very impressive. Impressive, yes, except on paydays. - Well, Inspector, what can I possibly... - Mister. OK, Mac, what can I tell you? It's about that child that was burned, any idea how it happened? Well, not for sure, no. It's possible he may have handled that sample container of mine. Oh, the case of the missing radiation. Yes, I've heard about that already. - From the Director? - From the Director. There's no doubt as to his opinions about the matter. What about yours? Oh, I'm not entitled to have any opinion. I'm only interested in facts. I was talking to that old reprobate up in the tower, old Tom. One fact I did manage to learn was that child never went near that container of yours. He was burned by something else. Dr. Royston, I'd like you to help me find out what it was. I'm so sorry. Oh, Willie. I expect you'd like to stay here awhile, use my room. Thank you. The boy's parents. Is he dead? I'm afraid so, he never regained consciousness Adam, we've got to find out how this thing happened! - That's what we're trying to do, Doctor. - Kelly. - McGill That's why we came to seek for it. Dr. Royston, isn't it? - Mr. Harding, how... - There's nothing you can say will help. I know about you, Dr. Royston! You're a scientist, not a doctor. You don't look after the sick You meddle with things that kill, like they killed my boy in here. You should be locked up Royston. Locked up with other like you. Letting off bombs you can't control. You're not safe. You're a murderer. Mr. Harding, please. I don't know what to do. I just don't know. My wife! I don't think he really meant what he said, Adam. Yes, he did, Mac. He meant it. I'm sure you know, that though it all, we only try to create, not destroy. Two minutes? Right. Zena, in here. Hmm, cozy. - Convenient too. - So I've heard from the other nurses. You don't want to take any notice of what they tell you. Oh, but I do, that's why I'm here. What did you think I came down for? A course of... radium treatment? Zena, darling, why didn't we start doing this earlier? I've given you enough encouragement, haven't I? But you should've been more direct. You should've come up and said... Harry, I want... I want... - What the? - It switched on. Must be your electric personality. Stay here, don't move. This is where we stored the radium. Yes. Obviously, the radium was the target. Safe proved no obstacle whatsoever, did it? What sort of heat would be required to do this? Heat far beyond anything we ever dreamed of. Don't forget the time element. Whatever happened in here must've taken place in a few seconds. Perhaps we'll learn a bit more when we can talk to the girl. Look, there's another thing, Adam. - I know, it's all over the place. - Same as in your workshop. Any luck? I don't know if she'll recover, but I think it would be a good thing if we got here away from here as quickly as possible. You mean she won't be able to tell us what happened? She won't be able to tell you her own name. Royston? What is this? What are we dealing with? How could anyone get in here when there are people outside there in the corridor all the time? Well, apparently, this is the only place it could come in. But, the grill doesn't open, it's cemented to the wall. - Came in through the grill. - But, Adam, that's impossible. Whatever it was that did all this certainly wasn't small enough to come through that. Well, how small is 10,000 gallons of oil? What do you mean? 10,000 gallons of oil would take up a pretty large area, wouldn't it? And yet, 10,000 gallons of oil could come through the holes in that grill, couldn't it? Yes, it could. Then, that's the way it got into my workshop, it came in under the door. You know, obviously... this thing can take up any shape it needs to. Where do you think it is now? Somewhere out on the ridges. Well, thank goodness that Major didn't take my advice and station a couple soldiers out there. But he did. Brew up! - What's that? - Tea. You don't hear something? Like what? I don't know. Must have been... No, it couldn't have been. Hey, Spider, there's a really great glow out here. - What is it, Haggis? - I'm not sure. - You better go and have a look. - Yeah. - Why me? - Frightened? Yeah.... and I don't mind admitting it either. You know these parts better than me, you go have a look. I don't know these parts. - You're a Scott, ain't ya? - Aye, but I was born 300 miles from here. Doesn't matter now, anyhow, it's gone away. Well, I suppose I'd better go have a look. - Keep my tea warm, Spider. - OK. Here, Haggis... Haggis, I've been thinking... Why don't you and me go to Glasgow on our next 48? You can show me the castle! Hey, Spider, come here, quick! Look! Haggis?! Haggis?! What's the matter, Haggis?! What is it, Haggis? Haggis?! Where are you, Haggis? Haggis? Guard?! Guard! Looks like we're too late. I suggested this meeting because I think I have an idea of what we may be dealing with. Perhaps one of you may have a solution. Then again, perhaps one of you may think I'm talking a lot of nonsense and can offer a more logical conclusion. What's this going to be then, Adam, fact or theory? Partly fact, mostly theory. I see, well, carry on, we're all listening. I'd like to resurrect for just a moment, if I may, a treatise I did when I was a student. Which has to do with the cooling of the earth's Surface. Hundred's of millions of years ago, the earth was like the sun... ...no form, no solidity to it, it was just a blazing mass of energy. And then the Earth started cooling, and as it cooled an outer crust was formed. The energy was still there, but it was being compressed beneath this crust. As time went by, the crust grew deeper. An the compression became greater as this vast energy was being squeezed into an ever decreasing space. May I interrupt a moment, Adam? What you're telling us is something every schoolboy knows. What's it leading to? I'm sorry, maybe I should skip the preliminaries. No, don't skip anything, Adam, I was never very bright at school. Well, then in a comparatively short space of time, a matter of a 100 thousand years, man has evolved. And man has evolved from nothing, to becoming the most intelligent creature on the surface of this planet. Now, considering the far greater span of time involved... ...isn't it reasonable to assume that the forces contained in the center of this earth... ...have developed an intelligence of their own? If we accept this, we must then consider what these forces would think. Their world is slowly being compressed out of existence. Therefore, survival must be uppermost in their thoughts. What's more natural in their search for survival than that they should return to the face of the planet where once they lived. Now... ...if you check, you will find every 50 years, by virtue of the position of the Earth in the solar system, a greater pull is exerted on the surface of this planet than at other times. Quite unnoticeable to us, but 2,000 miles down, who knows? And during the short period of time that this pull is at it's most powerful, you will also find there's always been a freak earth tremor. And that in each of these cases, a fissure has opened in the surface of the Earth. Now, what if, on these occasions, some of the vast energy trapped below had caused the eruptions or tremors in an attempt to reach the surface? What if, in fact, it did reach the surface? It looked around for a means to sustain its existence. For to live, one must have nourishment. And these forces are almost pure energy, and what does energy live on? - Energy. - Exactly. Energy can only be fed with more energy... or... ...radiation, if you like. 50, 100, 150 years ago, these forces found themselves without any means of sustenance and their mass became unstable and they disintegrated. Now, we come to this 50 year cycle... ...this time, there's radiation! There was radiation in the hospital. There was radiation in my workshop! As long as this thing feeds, it will live. And the more it lives, the more it will grow. It's fantastic. I admit, it does sound that way, doesn't it? But if anyone can offer a simpler explanation of what's been going on, I'd be grateful and relived to hear it. You're trying to tell us that some kind of creature came up out of the fissure? Mac, I'm not trying to tell you anything, I'm just putting forward a theory based on the facts that we know. - So, what do we look for? - I don't know. And what do we do if we find something? I'm afraid I don't know that either. How big is this thing supposed to be? Might be the size of my fist. Might be as large as a house. We can't stand about here, we've got to find this thing, and destroy it. Destroy it? How are you going to do that, shoot it, burn it, blow it up? Listen to me, all of you! We've been told a story based on a little fact, and a great deal of fiction. I'm amazed that this story has been accepted by all of you without the slightest doubt or hesitation. I said just now that I thought the whole thing was fantastic, I'll go further than that... ...it's absolute rubbish! Dr. Royston, you're a scientist, you deal with facts. A man of your intelligence and capabilities has no right to talk as you have. You astound me! - What about that boy being burned? - We've been all through that. And that business at the hospital? There must be some perfectly logical explanation for it, I suggest we leave the police to find out what it is. I'm the police, in a way, and I've come here to get Dr. Royston's advice. In that case, I'll waste no more time. Good night, gentlemen. I'm sorry if anybody else feels that way. Let's try and get a look at this thing. The only way we can do that is go to the fissure. But we've been there more than once already. We've seen nothing. You misunderstood me. Somebody has got to go down in the fissure. Well, all ready, sir. Peter, now, you're quite sure you still want to go through with this? I know, we've argued this out before. After all, I did volunteer for the job. - He's right, Adam. - OK, Peter. Thank you. - Senior doesn't like it at all. - Ha ha, nor do any of us. Director of the establishment’s been on to him, told him he thinks the whole things a waste of time. I hope you're not in any trouble, Major. Not yet, but I have strict orders what to do. All ready. Sir. - You're all right now, are you? - Yes, sure. What's the drill? If there's any radioactivity on that Geiger counter, let us know and we'll get you out of there. Right, lower it away. Keep going. Lower. Lower away. Keep going, Lower. You all right, sir? Nothing to report, sir. Lower. Oop. - Oop, stop, stop there! - Hold it! All right, lower away again. Stop lowering! You all right, sir? He's all right. What is it? He's all right, but something's happening, sir. No, it's all right, keep lowering. Keep lowering! Stop! Stop lowering! Get me out of here, quick! Faster! Faster! Faster! Fast as you can! Come on now! Bring him up, boys. Come on, boys! Faster! Heave! Faster! Crank faster! You were right, sir. There's a body of a soldier down there. - It's all burnt up. - What else? Well, never mind about that, let's get away from here. Peter, what did you see down there? I don't know what it was, it was like something out of a nightmare, it was horrible. We'll talk about that later, and you get in the car, Peter. I told you I had my orders, sir. They were to take action if anything was found down there. What sort of action? Kill whatever it is, and concrete the whole thing over. Concrete it over? - You don't mean that? - Those are my orders. Well, Major, when do you start? Tonight, right away. - Sergeant? - Right, sir! Well, you seem to be making a job of it. I think this should do the trick. What about you? You know this Royston chap, brilliant of course, I'm sure. But the trouble with some of these scientific types is they can't see the easy way out of anything. It's got to be complicated if it's going to work. Come in, come in. Hello, Mac. Where you been all day? Here, hold this. - Down at the fissure. - Oh, they finished down there? - What did they do, exactly? - Practically everything. Flame throwers, high explosive, and a neat little concrete tombstone. Rest in peace, huh? You don't think it's done any good, do you? Well, how could it? Let's look at the facts, you know this... Here, give me that. There's this \"X\", this unknown quantity, whatever it is, has forced it's way through miles and miles of solid rock. How's a couple feet of concrete going to stop it? But what about the flamethrowers and explosive? Nothing could live after that! Perhaps nothing we've ever encountered before, but... ...no, this isn't a living organism, as we know it. It's life source may be the same as we've got here. Stay on the side of the screen. That's good. Now, Mac, how would you go about killing that? What is it? It's a particle of mud. And by virtue of it's atomic structure, emits radiation. That's all it is, just mud. How do you kill mud? Have you informed anyone in London about all this? Hmm, no more than a half a dozen times. And? Well, at first they were interested, but skeptical. They suggested I get in touch with the Director about it. And later on, the Director got in touch with them. The result is, I've been called back to London. - When? - Tonight. I'm catching the last plane from Glasgow. Mac, I'm sorry to hear that. You've become one of my staunchest allies. Adam, this thing is going to break out again, isn't it? In my opinion, yes. Isn't there anything we can do to stop it? I don't know. Something I've been working on a long time now. A method of... ...disintegrating atomic structure, obviating with the sudden explosion. Well, it's... Look, what's an atomic bomb? It's a breaking up of atomic particles, isn't it? Well, not quite, but that's close enough. You see, I'm trying to achieve this breaking up, without the explosion. This is a... Look, I'll show you. Now, in that lead container is an atomically unstable compound. Two things can happen to it... Either it will continue to give off radiation for the next 200 years, or it can be subjected to an outside force which will disintegrate it in a fraction of a second. - A bomb, in fact. - Well, if you like, yes. But see, that's what I'm trying to prevent. Now, theoretically... ...if you draw this stuff between the scanners... ...and adjust the scanners to a certain pitch, a neutralizing affect should be achieved. You mean to say that this apparatus would neutralize an atomic bomb? - So that it wouldn't explode? - That's my point, it couldn't. It couldn't, it wouldn't be a bomb anymore, it would just be a handful of mud and a very expensive casing. But, Adam, that's fantastic! A step in the right direction anyway, isn't it, Mac? Will you be able to use this against that thing out there? Six months time, perhaps, but... Yes, Russell, what is it? Mr. Peters sent me down to remind you of the time, sir. Oh... yes, yes, thank you. Oh, Russell, you were able to locate Mr. Elliott, weren't you? - Not yet, no sir. - Oh, that's too bad. All right, thank you, I'll be right out. We're taking the cobalt out of the pile tonight, and we haven't been able to locate John yet. Well, Mac, we're sure going to miss you around here. Goodbye, Adam. Good luck. - Peter, is that truck ready? - Yes, it's standing by outside, sir. Well, as soon as these are all out, I want you to get a quick reading, and then we'll load them. The pile is now inactive! The pile is now inactive! OK, boys, let's get started and I'll get these out. No, sir, I don't. I think we have every chance of seeing it again. Excuse me... I'm sorry, sir, the lines bad. Yes, I see. But I only want one more night, sir. If nothing happens, I can catch the first plane tomorrow morning. Station Sergeant speaking. Yes, of course. Aye. Aye. Where? Well, thank you, sir. Oh, there's one other thing. I believe the Director, Mr. Elliott's got in touch with you earlier today. You must speak up, this phone's bad! - Oh, yes, I've seen him. - I've got that. What about the occupants? They what? You must be mad! No sir, he doesn't, I know, but all the same. All right, sir. Very well, good night. All right, I'll send somebody out right away! Williams, I want you to go out, there's been an accident! Right, Sarge. - Thank you, Sergeant. - Right, sir And tell McGowan to report to me when he comes off duty. People melting, indeed. - What's that you say? - Oh, there's been an accident, sir. Four miles from here. Yes, I know, I heard that, but what's this about people melting? Well, that's what the man on the beat said, I think he must be... Let me have that address. Thank you. Hey, what do you think you're doing? Do you hear me? I say, what do you think you're doing? Sorry, sir. Where's the nearest telephone? The nearest public phone is a couple of miles away, sir. But maybe one of these people will let you use theirs. Anybody live near here have a phone? Aye, there's a phone in my shop, half a mile down the road. You can use that. Thanks very much. Pop in the car, I'll drive you down. Dr. Royston? John, we've just taken the cobalt out of the pile. - There wasn't time... - On who's authority? Well, there wasn't really time to check with you. You know how long it takes to get that pile started again. You'll put the cobalt bombardment weeks behind schedule. Entirely on you own initiative, you break in on an official experiment. You deactivate the pile without consulting me. This isn't your workshop, Royston! This is a government establishment, and I'm it's director. Look, I'm sorry, you'll have to speak louder. No, he's busy right now, this is Peter Elliott. Oh yes. Yes. I'll tell him, right away. Dr. Royston, it's McGill. It appears what you were afraid of has happened. It's just killed 4 people in a car. The lines terrible, but I think he said they'd melted. Hello, Mac, this is Royston. What's this all about? Yes, yes, wait a minute. Just a minute. Do you have a pencil, please? Go ahead. Yes. Where? Yes, right... right. Got it. Do you have a local surveying map in your office? Yes, there's one up there. - Let's take a look at it. - Yes, of course, come on. This point right here is the fissure. Now, here is the hospital. This is where something was seen glowing. Now, over here, is my workshop. If we follow this line, right here is the old tower. You know, this thing can obviously sense radioactivity. And once it does, nothing can stop it. Makes straight for the radiation. And then returns to the fissure. And by these lines, it's pretty clear it returns by the same route. Now, this latest report, this burned out car, is right here. Now, if we extend the line from the fissure through this point, somewhere along this extended line is where it's headed. - I see. - Here! That's right, it's on its way for the biggest meal of it's life! Hurry up, man, hurry up, open the gate! - All right, all right. - Oh, come along, man, open up the gate. - Let's see your pass. - Oh, you know me. - Come along, open up! - Sorry, sir, let's see your pass first. - Here. - All right, sir. We daren't put that cobalt back in the pile, we've got to get it out of here fast. There must be a limit to the distance it can sense radiation. We've got to get beyond that point. Adam, I just wanted to say that... Oh, never mind. I'll go and warn the security people. - Mac. - Adam. - Any sign of it yet? - No, not yet. It can't be far off. I've warned everybody to keep indoors. Upstairs, if possible. I posted every man I could lay hands on to keep watch for it. I tried to phone London again, but there's something the matter with the lines. It's all interference. We've got the same trouble here. - Nobody's spotted a thing, huh? - None of my men have seen anything. I'd like to know why? A thing that big simply can't disappear. No, but it might alter it's form and become almost invisible. Isn't that true? What's going on here? We're trying to get this cobalt loaded and out of here. What about the gates around this place? They're being watched. I'd like to phone around the gates, if I may? There's a phone in there. The line isn't very good, I'm afraid. Peter! Check the main gate. See if you can spot it. Clear this yard, boys! - Adam, what about the cobalt? - There's nothing we can do about that now. But if it gets near, it might explode it. Then we'll be the first to explode a cobalt bomb, now clear out of here! Boys, get out of this yard! Come on! Hello! Wait a minute! It's the main yard gate. Where can we see it from? Up that ladder, sir! Tell everyone to stay clear of the west approach to the reactor building. It's coming in that way. Our only chance is the hope that it absorbs radiation. Won't that make it unstable as the cobalt decays? Yes, yes it would. Dr. Royston... ...its on its way. The man on the main gate had it just like the others. It's coming in on the west side. Look! There it is on the roof! Up there, quick! It's growing larger. The mass has to increase to accommodate the extra radiation. How big will it get? The important thing is how unstable is it going to get? Isn't there anything we can do? Well, we can try, but not here. The only thing we can do is to let it go back to the fissure. Now we know the exact route it will take so let's clear that route and get everybody out of its path. I'll see if the army has a helicopter. We can use that to keep a check on it, in case it changes direction. What are you going to do, Adam? - I'm going down to my workshop. - It's moving. Any luck? I can't hear a thing, the static's drowning out everything. The sergeant says that's a sure sign the thing's not far off. - Aye, let's get back to Lock Mouth. - Aye. Come on now, hurry! You'll be safe inside the chapel. Come on now. Inside, hurry! - Do you need any help, minister? - I don't think so. How near is it going to come? It should pass within a 100 yards of where you are now. Between those trees. - How much longer. - About 2 minutes, as far as I can tell. Come on, Mrs. McGinty, let me take your bundle. Come on, it's nice and warm inside. There you are. It's changed direction, it's not following the same route. Plot a map the other way out. That was close. Army copter to mobile, heading out from Loch Mouth, traveling east. Oh, what's the use, they'll never hear anything in this static. - Are you getting all this, lad? - Oh, yes, sir. Oh, fine, let's get over to Check Point 3. Just... there. Come on, ladies, hurry, there is no time to lose, hurry! Inside, quickly! Wait here. Every line out of this place is useless. Radio's even worse. There's no hope of getting through to London now. We've got to handle this ourselves. I still think that as soon as it gets to the fissure, we ought to leave it alone. That is, until we can get in touch with the ministry. Look, Mr. Elliott, Adam says the larger this thing grows, the more its range will increase. You know the next point it will make for? There, that's it, the experimental nuclear power station at Glen Cardiff. And to reach there, it will go right through the center of Inverness. Now do you see, we've got to stop this thing at the fissure. And we've got to stop it for good. - Well, Adam? - How's it going? Not too good, I'm just ready to try again. Watch out now, just in case. - That's it, it's worked. - You've done it, Adam, you've done it! Adam, look! The container, it's glowing! What's happening, sir? Well, that won't do, we'll have to try again. There's no time to try again! If a piece of material no bigger than a pin head can cause an explosion like that can't you imagine what would happen out there? We've got to have time! I don't care, Adam, we've got to take the chance! We've got to try and stop this thing at the fissure! Dr. Royston? Those scanners, they could have slipped out of synchronization. They might have, yes. Might have been a hundred other things. But could it have been the scanners, Adam? Yes, yes, they... ...being out of sync might have caused it. Everything you've asked for is at the fissure, Adam. Trucks, radioactive material... everything's ready! Well, if that's the way it's got to be, let's get started. Tell them to get that copter away from here. Noise enough to wake the dead, let alone that thing down there. Right, sir. - Is everything here, Major? - I don't know yet. What are all these men doing? Mac, let's clear this area. Well, if anything goes wrong, it won't matter much where they are. True, but they'll get in our way. Now, is this our Jeep? That's it, just as you ordered. You know what you got on the back there is bait, don't you? Yes, sir. The purpose is to entice whatever is down there, out. Now don't you get any closer than 15 feet, you understand that? Very good, sir. Let's get started. - Have the trucks follow. - Right. - Mr. Thomson, follow this car down. - Right, sir. Now, Peter, don't let that Jeep get any closer than 15 feet. - Remember that, 15 feet. - Right, sir! Can we do anything to help, Adam? No, Mac, just keep your fingers crossed. Right, well, we'll stay out of your way, anyhow. Major, impress upon your men the importance of keeping these scanners in phase. As soon as we're ready, I'll give the signal for the switch on. Right. Everything all right? Thank you, sir. I've got the cobalt out. - I'll get the men under cover, sir. - What's that? Yes, yes! Hold it, you lads, take cover. Come along all of you, get your heads down behind this bank here. Come on, Dole, what are you waiting for? What's going to happen, Sarge? I'm gonna kick you head in if you don't get it down, that's what's gonna happen. Give me the OK as soon as you're synchronized. - Right! - You ready number one? - Ready, sir! Are you ready number two? Ready, sir! Excuse me, Major. Peter! Turn on the Jeep. Bring out the Jeep! Hey, what's the matter? Right, come on, get out, I'll take it. Good luck, sir! You better take cover too. It's Peter. - What do you think you're doing? - The drivers sick. That's no reason why you should do it. What's he doing? Peter! Peter, don't go any closer! Peter, don't go any closer! Peter! Peter! Peter, don't be a fool! Get back! Get back! Peter! Peter, get out, Peter! Get out, and try to walk! All right! Switch on! - Switch on! - Right, sir! Switch on! It's gone. Adam, it's gone! It worked, Mac, didn't it? Bring out the Geigers! Let's have a reading! What was that? I don't know, but it shouldn't have happened. But the thing's gone! You should be very proud, Adam. Your theories worked! It has, Adam.", "url": "https://subslikescript.com/movie/X_the_Unknown-49967"},

They're definitely  fucking with us. -Maybe they're sick.  -In the head? -They might need help.  -I don't think so. What are you... Oh, man! (SIGHING) Hello? I don't think  that's their car. Hey, are you guys okay? MATT: What the fuck? -Oh, shit!  -Oh, my God. -Oh, shit! -(MEN LAUGHING) Fuck! Move, come on! Run! Go. Go, go, go! -GEORGIA: Seat belts on! -Come on! MATT:  Can you make it go any faster? Oh, you hired  this piece of shit! (PANTING) After these assholes,  a giant man-eating cat... Oh, shit! I guess there's more to England than Supernanny  and Prince Harry. MATT: I'm beginning to doubt  this farmhouse will have HBO. GEORGIA: Mmm. MATT: Running water? Hello? Fox? (DOOR CREAKING) MATT: It's open. If he didn't answer,  it means he's probably gone. Gone where? Milk a horse for breakfast?  How the fuck would I know? (CLANGING) -(SQUAWKING) -(GEORGIA YELPS) It's just a bird. Fox? Are you in here? It's me, Georgia. MATT: Nice. (INSECT BUZZING) Was this dude  a fucking junkie? Ahh! Get out! Go!  Get out of here! -Okay.  -Come on. Great start, he's probably  been murdered by crackheads. Or sacrificed like  the Wicker Man. Get out of here. Or not. (FLIES BUZZING) Why would anyone want  to set fire to sheep? GEORGIA: Let's ask him. Hey. Hey. All right already. (CHUCKLING) Who's this? Uh, Matt, this is Conrad Fox. Fox, this is Matt. I thought you were  coming alone. (LAUGHING) I told you about  my boyfriend. Matt. Remember? Right, yeah. Nice to meet you, man. I heard a lot about you. Welcome to Xmoor. So what happened to these sheep? They were left behind,  became easy prey. You mean a cat killed them? Those that didn't starve. (COUGHING) You all right? So, the people who  lived here before,  did they see the cat? They were too concerned with keeping the wolf from the door. Well, they better not  come back here 'cause there's a crazy drug  addict living in their house. -(CHUCKLES)  -Have you seen her? I brought her. GEORGIA:  Can you tell us your name? Just ask her about the beast. Can you describe what happened? KARA: It were last month. I was lost. The mist had come down  and I couldn't see  where I was going. I heard a noise behind me and... All of a sudden,  the beast come out of nowhere  and knocked me over. I didn't know what hit me. He held me down and  tried to bite my throat out. How can you be sure  it was a male? Males are more aggressive. Were you badly hurt? Did you think it was  gonna kill you? Yeah. If I hadn't of got away, I'd be lying dead on that moor right now. We should have  never come back here. How did you get away  from the beast? I ran until my feet bled. Those scars on your arms,  are they from the beast? I don't want to do this no more. (SOBBING) She's still very traumatized. (DOOR CLOSING) -It's what we agreed.  -That's it? It's all I've got and  it's what we agreed, okay? Yeah, but you never  said you were gonna  film me, did you? (TALKING INDISTINCTLY) Is the mic on that camera  picking anything up? No, too far away. Well, she's more  than just camera shy. She's a fucking meth head. What were you saying  about this dude again? -Do you want a repeat  of the Sasquatch trip?  -Mmm-mmm. Fox is an animal tracker,  we don't have a hope in hell of finding any  big cats without him. Okay and what is  Doctor Dolittle  using for guidance? Hmm, is that directions scribbled out by a crack whore? (LAUGHING) Why, yes it is. What exactly does this dude  know about animals? He's got over 20 years'  experience tracking big cats in Peru, Buton,  and South Africa. Where do you think  he dug up Skeletor? Come on, Matt, not everyone  is as lucky as we are. I'm sure he could afford a couple of items off the dollar menu  for his girlfriend. She's not his girlfriend. -How do you...  -(CELL PHONE RINGING) -Oh, shit, it's my boss. -Don't answer it. No, no, no, no. I got to.  It's like 3:00 a.m. there. He must be calling  about the cameras. Mr. Saperstein, good morning.  How are you? (INDISTINCT SPEAKING  OVER THE PHONE) Not good. Okay, uh, what? You're rambling.  (STAMMERS) Slow down. (SCREAMING) GEORGIA: Don't touch me! Get off right now! Get off!  (SCREAMING) MAN 1: Keep your mouth shut! There must have been some  mistake. I'm sure I can... Did you hear that? MAN 1: Hold her down.  Hold her down.  MAN 2: I am. -Don't touch me! Ahh! -MAN 1: Pull her trousers down. GEORGIA: Matt! Matt! (MUFFLED SCREAMING) If I could just explain... (MAN SCREAMING) FOX: Get out  of the fucking van! (MAN SCREAMING) Matt! Matt! Georgia, over here. Over here. (GRUNTING) -Fucking down, stay down!  -Fox, what the fuck? MAN: Please.  MATT: Fox! MAN: We didn't know,  I swear. I swear. Fuck off! It's all right. It's all right. (GASPING) (CREAKING) GEORGIA: It was those kids   who burned out the car. And they were going through   our stuff and when they   saw me, they... (VOICE QUIVERS)  They grabbed me. MATT: He was gonna kill   that kid, wasn't he? Did you see   the size of that gun? He was only trying  to protect me. He isn't a threat. MATT: I hope you're right. We should get going. -Hey, you don't have to...  -It's getting late. (ENGINE STARTING) (GASPS) You promised you'd take me back! (SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY) MATT: What the... Dude...  GEORGIA: Fox! Don't leave me! Don't leave me! GEORGIA: Shouldn't we at least  offer to give her a ride? There isn't time.  We've got a lot of ground  to cover in the light. Well, what if those  guys come back  and she's here all alone? (LAUGHING) They wouldn't dare. Seriously, Fox,  this isn't right. (SIGHS) She has money for  a taxi, she's got a phone. -But she's... -In need of a couple of days detox. Dude, that's cold. Well, believe me,  she's better off there than back on the moor. MATT: How big is the moor? FOX: 267 square miles. GEORGIA: That's big. FOX: Same size as Singapore. The biggest hunt was  Operation Beastie in '83. The army sent 40 soldiers  out for a fortnight.  They saw a cat, but couldn't get  a clean shot on it. MATT: Oh, and if the military  can't find him, what  chance do we have? That's what they said when  I hunted down the blue tiger. You know, Fox, I think it'd  make a better documentary  if we didn't kill the cat. Then you should have hired  David Bellamy. I'm a hunter. (SOFTLY) Who the fuck  is David Bellamy? How the fuck should I know? (PANTING) Should I start getting  these set up? Not yet, wait until  he gets the scent. This way. I'm beginning to get  the scent... Of bullshit. Meow! Matt, get out of the way. GEORGIA: How long do you think  it'll be before we see  evidence of the panther? Um, there's no such  thing as a panther. -But you said that...  -Escaped cats were  melanistic leopards. The theory is that they  interbred with other species  of anomalous cats -over the years to create  breeds like the pumapard. -(MATT LAUGHS) What are you doing? Are you drinking already? Nope. (SIGHS) (GRUNTS) Hey, can I get some help? (GRUNTING) MATT:  What the hell's a pumapard? GEORGIA: (CHUCKLES)  It's a half-puma,   half-leopard crossbreed. MATT: Next we'll be   looking for ligers. GEORGIA: He knows   what he's doing. MATT: Really? 'Cause   we've been walking all day and I'm beginning to   think that Captain Ahab couldn't find a kid  in a ball of string. Shouldn't we be heading back to civilization before it gets too dark? Aw! Why do we need to find  the cat when we already have the biggest pussy  in England right here? This is it. What? Slew Wood.  The lair of the beast. Okay, let's get these up  quick, we don't want to miss  the beast's evening meal. Oh, a covert camera. Transmits a signal to  the hard drive in my bag, recording an individual stream of each camera. Kind of technical. You wouldn't understand. So this is what you   bring to the party. How many you got? -Forty-two.  -Huh. Better get a move on, then,  hadn't you? (MOCKING)  Better get a move on, then,  hadn't you? (SIGHS) (BIRD FLUTTERING) (HEAVY BREATHING) (GROWLING) God, you're such a dork. This place is foul. Hope we're not standing in the middle of some giant kitty litter tray. -Ugh.  -You know,  it smells more like... -Death?  -(TWIGS SNAPPING) (GASPS) Fox? No. How long do you think  it'll take for you to set  up the viewing station? (BOTH MUMBLING) Ooh! God. -Are you okay?  -(PANTING) Yeah. Phew. -Oh, shit.  -What? Can you just stop it?  You're freaking me out. What? I don't see any... (SCREAMING) (BREATHING HEAVILY) -Was that a leg? -I think it was. -It was a fucking leg!  -(SCREAMING) (GASPING) I heard screaming. There's a body. -Where?  -Over there on the ground. Show me. (MATT DRY HEAVING) Oh, Jesus Christ. (RETCHING AND COUGHING) Oh! Oh, the smell. Oh! (GRUNTING) (GASPING) She's been here for some time. -She?  -(PANTING) Fox, you told me  the cat just killed animals! The cat's not  responsible for this. Unless it's learned  how to tie knots. The phone won't work. There's  not a mast for 20 miles. This girl has a family  who must be going  out of their minds! When we get out of here... -What? What is it?  -Ahh! (ALL SHRIEKING) -Another one?  -Yes, another fucking one! GEORGIA: Why would there be  two dead bodies  in the same place? Three, four... Look! Five, six! (SHRIEKS)  Stop fucking counting! What is this place? It's a dumping ground. A what? He's right. Sometimes they dump  all the bodies in the same  remote place. (STAMMERING) Who? Guys like Ted Bundy,  Gary Ridgway, they return  to the sites so they can... So they can what? (PANTING) Fuck the corpses. (GEORGIA SHUDDERING) Run! Where are you going? Hey! Hey, Georgia.  Hey, Georgia! Wait! (TERRIFIED PANTING) Come on! Come on! (PANTING) (COUGHING) You got the compass? -It's in my bag, but...  -What about the map? We  want to get back to the van. -You okay?  -(GASPING) Who would do that  to those girls? A beast more  gruesome than any cat. Well, the sooner the cops  get here, the sooner we... If we tell the police now,  that beast will get away. We have to tell the police.  There are dead girls in there  and they deserve justice. And we're the only chance  they've got of getting it. (EXHALES) Listen, it's like Matthew said,  when someone creates  a dumping ground like that, they tend to make  a habit of returning  to it very regularly. Listen, Georgia, the police  are bound by procedure. They're obliged to  remove the bodies immediately. But if they were to leave  them there and wait, there's a good chance the  killer would walk into a trap. Fox, if you're suggesting what  I think you're suggesting... Filming the hunt and capture  of a serial killer would make headline news all over the world. Wait in the forest to catch a serial killer is the single most suicidal  idea I have ever heard  in my entire fucking life! We don't need to do this!  Haven't you even heard of DNA? The cameras are rigged, my gun's loaded. One night is all I'm asking. Then at dawn,  whatever happens, we go  and report what we found. Seriously, where did  you find this maniac? We'd be heroes for catching a serial killer that was right under the nose  of the police while they were too  fucking foolish to see it. You knew. You fucking knew. What are you talking about? This was never  about finding the cat, it was all about  setting him up as  the hero of the ultimate hunt, the most dangerous game  of all, isn't that right, Fox? Georgia, don't be ridiculous,  he wouldn't lie about... How did you know? Tell me how you knew. Tell me! My fiance Camille was murdered  in South Africa two years ago. I was lost, I ran out of money, I had to come back home to Exeter. I hadn't lived here  for 20 years. Everyone  I knew had long since gone. I went on the Internet and  I met a girl called Allison. She was a prostitute. All right, stop there. We're not judging you  for what you've done. We just want to get out of here. I'm not a killer. She was my friend. She helped me to open up. I finally began to feel like  I hadn't died, with Camille. Anyway, one day she  wasn't there anymore,  she wasn't anywhere. And she wasn't the only one,  several girls had disappeared,  and no one seemed to care. That's when I met Kara. Who's Kara? FOX: The girl   we left at the farm. I knew that bitch had  never seen a cat! The beast drugged her  and brought her here to those woods. She managed to   claw her way free   and escape across the moor. (PANTING) GEORGIA: Why didn't   she tell the police? FOX: She did. They came   out here, had a look,   but obviously not hard enough. I suspected something  but believe me, I never imagined anything like  what we found in there. Let's get out of here. And regret it for  the rest of your life? Well, should we stay out here, it may only be another couple of hours. GEORGIA: You shouldn't  have lied to me, Fox. I know. GEORGIA: Just  wait for a second. MATT: Come on,  just fucking walk! GEORGIA: Slow down,  just take a second. MATT: We need to keep going.  We gotta keep moving. GEORGIA: Slow down.  Can't you calm down? Ah, my fucking ankle! (GROANS PAINFULLY) Fuck! GEORGIA: Can you walk? (MATT GROANS)  We can't slow down. GEORGIA: Maybe if we  just take a second. We need to keep going.  Ahh! Jesus. We don't even know  which way to go. (PANTING) Just stick with me,  I'm gonna get you  off of this moor. (GEORGIA YELPS) -Matt? Matt!  -(GASPING) Come on, come on. Here you go. Matt! MATT: Help! GEORGIA: You've got to  grab my hand. Grab hold of the stick. Grab hold of the stick! Right. Hold on.  One, two, three, pull! One, two, three, pull! (GROANING) (ALL GASPING) (COUGHING) GEORGIA: You okay? Fuck this place! (ANIMAL YELPS) (SHIVERING) (EXHALES) Listen, I was born here  and I wouldn't risk  crossing the moor at night. Can you make it back  to van on that... It's a day away, two perhaps  with a sprained ankle. What if we both help him? We need to get him proper  bandages and dry clothes from his bag or he'll  die of hypothermia. I followed you two for about  a mile and you didn't notice. I might not have  been the only one. (SHIVERING) So, we go back  to the forest, and what then? We get you changed,  then we wait. And what if the beast shows? You film me apprehending him  and we take him to the law. This isn't The Cat of  the Baskervilles! He's one overconfident, unarmed loner, who won't be expecting  an armed hunter or our eyes in the trees. Bullshit, we can't  do this. Matt! The girl I met in the Red Line  that night spoke until dawn about how she wanted her films to be noticed. I've spent my entire life  hunting innocent animals, you spent yours trying  to film figments  of people's imaginations. Now we've got a chance  to do something real. Something that matters!  And you want to run away! The only thing that matters to  me right now is staying alive. You really think  you can protect her? With my life. You can't be serious right  now. We need the cops  and we need them now! I can't protect you,  I couldn't before at the house  and I can't do shit now. Don't say that. We're  gonna tighten this up, we're gonna grab you  over our shoulders and  we're gonna make it back. I don't think we can make it  across the moor alone. Our best chance to  stay alive today is with Fox. So promise me when this  is over, you'll stay away from  that motherfucker. The hunt is on. (WHIMPERING) There's your stuff. (COUGHING) (GAGS) (GUN COCKING) We need to be able to see through all your cameras immediately. -It'll take at least an hour.  -I need it faster. -But I can't possibly... -Get to it. (EXHALES DEEPLY) Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh... (GROANS MOURNFULLY) Fuck. (FOX GROANING) Oh, shit. I told you to set up. (PANTING) I forgot the bandages. (WOMAN SCREAMS) (GASPS) (BIRD FLUTTERING) -(GASPING)  -It's okay, it's me. What took you so long anyway? -Just get the first aid. -Okay! Hurry the fuck up! -What is your problem!  -Get the fucking bandage. Would you calm down? I can fucking do it myself. Matt! (MOANS PAINFULLY) -You okay?  -Ah, yeah. (PANTING) -(GROANING)  -Are you okay? Okay. Let's go, let's go. -What? What do you mean? -Shut the fuck up and let's go. Let go, you're hurting me. -Let's go right now. -But you said the moors are too dangerous. -(PAINFUL GROAN) -What's gotten into you? -It's Fox. -FOX: I'm what? Where are you going  in such a hurry? -(FOX CRYING OUT IN PAIN)  -What are you doing? Come on lets go, he's the beast! What? How do you know? (FOX BELLOWING) Fox, get off him! Not until he's had  some discipline. Fox get off of him!  You're gonna kill him! (GROANS LOUDLY) Are you okay? I told you. What are you doing? Run! (PANTING) No one's  going anywhere. He killed those girls  and he brought us back here to find his handiwork! I saw him jacking off  on the bodies. Jesus, son, I wasn't there  for God's sake! Look, I've never hunted a man before. I went back in there  to steel myself, so that when the time comes, I wouldn't hesitate. Georgia,  how can you trust him? He went in with a goddamn bar! He brought you out  'cause he's planning  to kill you, too! Fox? If you're convinced  there's no killer out there, take my H&K. Go on, take it.  It's not a trick. Put it down, put it down.  Put that down! Just so long as you know, that if you're wrong and he appears, it will be up  to you to defend us. -Give it back now.  -We can't trust him. -Give him back the gun! -No fucking way! You don't know how to use it. It's not like pointing and  shooting a camera, Matthew. No second takes, no re-shoots. Hmm? You ready to pull the trigger to stop him  getting away? (PANTING) If it comes to that. Without killing him... 'Cause you'd go to fucking jail. I will do whatever it takes  to protect her. So be it. (GULPING) I need some more. What? This isn't a fucking  booze cruise. It's that stench. I need to burn it  out of my mouth. Don't give her anymore. (GAGGING) You never really believed  there were any cats out here, did you, Fox? They're out here, they just  keep their distance. Wouldn't the dead bodies attract the... MATT: It's bullshit! They don't exist. None of the cryptids do. The way I see it, human beings have  got so comfortable  in their surroundings, their minds start conjuring  up these imaginary predators just so they don't  die of boredom. FOX: Little do they know their new natural predator  drives a Land Rover. GEORGIA: There's good chance  he won't come tonight,  isn't there? Well, the nearly full moon  will give him enough light to see what he's doing. But Matthew's little tantrum  probably scared him off and he's halfway  to Borneo by now. Or maybe he's been  here the whole time. Think very carefully, Matthew. Ugh! It's so disgusting. -Georgia.  -(SOBS) For God's sake, be quiet. I can't do this anymore! Watching these dead girls  for hours and hours, smelling them rot. What they hell will people  think of us? -That you ruined everything.  -I don't care! -Shh.  -This is sick! Nothing is worth this. You need to find a way to get us out of here  right now, Fox. Georgia, calm down! I'm sorry. (EXCLAIMS IN FEAR) (STAMMERS) She's moving. Holy fucking shit! Was that... Matt! What was that? Something's alive out there. Kara was drugged. Maybe, maybe the beast drugs  all his victims so that he can return to them. Oh, that poor girl. FOX: The last person  she'll trust right now  is a man. We have to find her and you  have to call out to her. She's a young girl,  for Pete's sake! Who also happens to be the only person who can  identify the killer. All the more reason  to find her and make sure  she survives to tell. I don't think I can  go back in there. Imagine what it must be like  to wake up surrounded  by corpses. We have to help her. GEORGIA: Wait, where  are you going? The dumping ground's  that way. I heard some movement from  over here, call out. Do it! Hello? Call again, louder! Is anyone out there? We won't hurt you. Wait a minute,  if you're so friendly with all these prostitutes,  why don't you call out? Maybe they'll recognize your voice. Call again. We're going to get  you some help. This is pointless.  She can run as far  away from here as... -Shh!  -What? Sounds like...panting. Oh man, if a puma jumps out  on us, I swear... -No! -(YELPS) -Oh, fuck!  -Fox? Oh, my God!  Get the first aid kit. -What do we... -It's in your bag at the viewing station. Wait, don't you see  she attacked him? Matt, please get  the fucking bandages! Fox! Fox, can you hear me? Fox! (GROANING) Wake up! Get up, there you go. (GROANS) Ah, God damn it, Matt! Don't shine it in his face. What are you doing? Matt? Matt! Shit! I'm over here. Here you go. What is it? There was a torch, over there. Get the gun, the gun! Okay. Which way did he go? -I don't know.  -Oh, shit! Let off a warning shot. Okay. (GUN CLICKING) -Well, shoot it!  -I just did, nothing happened. Son of a bitch gave  me an unloaded gun. Georgia... Fuck him, let's just go! I am not leaving him here. -Fuck off!  -Fox, can you walk? Hurry the fuck up! The killer's here,  we need to go now. Where is he, where is he? Where are the bullets?  Load it! Load it! Come on! Stay behind me, stay behind me. You can't be serious. He's got the gun. We're so fucking dead. (MATT SHUDDERING) MATT: We're just going  in a huge circle. MAN: Choose wisely. (GUNSHOT) (VOICE IS DISTORTED)  Jesus Christ, Fox,  you could have hit me! Fox? (NORMAL VOICE RETURNS)  We need you back  with us, okay? You're scaring me. Why don't you give me the gun? Fox? -Guys.  -What? The girl. (SHUDDERING) Fox, calm down. It's okay. We won't hurt you. Okay. (SPEAKING ROMANIAN) Okay, okay, okay. Look. Putting it down,  putting it down. (SPEAKING ROMANIAN) Okay, okay. MATT: We don't have  time for this. Taking too long. -He's right.  -We need to move. You want to help her or not? Please don't be afraid. Please don't be afraid. Just grab her and go! You see something? I feel something. Huh? This... This  is his labyrinth. He brings them here,  to stalk them. Where are you going? Fox, come back here! Ah! (SCREAMING) Ahhh! (SHRIEKS) Matt, come on! (CRIES OUT) (PANTING) I'm a friend. I'm a... I'm a friend. Matt? Shit! (BOTH PANTING) Shh! What's your name? Vanya. I from Romania. I'm Georgia. I'm from America. Why you here? We were looking for a cat. A very big cat. (BOTH WHIMPERING) We're gonna get out  of here, Vanya, okay? You and me. My boyfriend, I have  to find my boyfriend. He... We don't know that. Bad man, he bring me here and hit me  and leave me to dead. He kill us. Or we kill him. Come on. Come on. (SOFT GROWL-LIKE NOISE) You hear? (NOISE CONTINUES) Animal? The cat. (GUTTURAL BREATHING) Fox! (GASPS) Georgia, do it! Do it, now! Do what? He took my gun  or I'd do it myself. -No, no, no.  -It's the humane thing to do. Don't let me die as his prey. I'll make my intentions clear on camera. No one will think you  did it maliciously. Fox, be quiet, you're gonna  attract the... Attract the beast... (CRIES OUT LOUDLY) (COUGHS) (GROANING) Please be quiet. I lied. I lied to you. I brought you in danger. (WHISPERS)  I told Matthew we fucked... But we didn't! I'll shout it so loud! He'll hear and he'll never  trust anything... Fuck! Fuck! (SPEAKING ROMANIAN) (SPITTING) Move now. Move now! Wait, I know where we are. Here, you take this. And drink this,  it'll help with the pain. Drink it. You watch! Why you do? We were looking for the panther. You lie! (SPEAKING ROMANIAN) (SCREAMING) Matt... Fuck! Fuck! Matt! Matt! Matt! Where are you? Matt, run to this! Matt! Matt! Please, Matt! (GUNSHOTS) (YELPS) (GUNSHOTS) (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) (BREATHING RAGGEDLY) (GROANS SOFTLY) (GROANING) (SCREAMING) (GLASS SHATTERING) (SHOUTS RHYTHMICALLY) Ahhh! (PANTING) (THUNDER CRACKING) (WHISPERS INDISTINCTLY) (METALLIC SQUEAKING) Hello? Is anyone there? (EXCLAIMS) Ahh! Are you a ghost? My daddy says there's  ghosts in the forest. Who's your daddy... Where's your daddy now? He's gone to hunt pheasants  for our tea. Do you like pheasants? Sorry. How often do you come  out here? When Daddy needs to hunt. Where's your mom? I don't have one anymore. She's a ghost now. What happened to your eye? Daddy will be back soon. (WOMAN SCREAMING) It isn't real! It isn't real! (ROARING) Don't go in there! (SHUTTING DOOR) Do you want to help  your daddy? You'd like that, wouldn't you? (WOMAN SCREAMING) (SPEAKING ROMANIAN) (SCREAMING) (BREATHING RAGGEDLY) (YELLS) (SCREECHING) (BIRD FLUTTERING) Vanya? Vanya. Vanya, wake up. Wake up, come on. Ahhh! (RIPPING) No! Play dead. (WHIMPERS) (SLASHING) Ahhh! You recognize the knife? Where is she? (SHOUTS) Where is she? Did you kill my boyfriend? The American guy. (GROANING) Tell me or you'll  be visiting your daughter's body in that dumping ground! Wait! You don't understand, they were all alive  when I left them! -Don't lie to me!  -It's true! (CRYING) Do you want me to  give you something to cry about,  you motherfucker! Please! Don't hurt my daughter. She never done nothing  to nobody. Where is Matt? I don't know! You can't finish  the job, can you? You're not man  enough to kill anyone, you just leave them there. -Vanya, wait! -Must kill him! (ALL CRYING OUT) (GROANING) Shit, shit! (FIRING GUN) Shit! Okay, okay, okay. No, no! Shit! (SHUDDERS) (MUFFLED BREATHING) (MAN SCREAMING) (WOMAN'S BLOOD-CURDLING SCREAM) (FLIES BUZZING) (WIND RUSTLING) (GRUNTS) (THUNDER RUMBLING) (PANTING) (GRUNTING) (SCREAMING) Ahhh! MAN: Hello? WOMAN: You all right? (SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) Hey, just stay there. (SCREAMING) Ahhh! Charlene! MARLENE: Dear Daddy,   I have gone   to get the police. We are going to come back and save you from the ghosts. No! No! (THUNDER RUMBLING) GEORGIA: I'm so glad you came. (RAIN POURING) MATT: Are you kidding?   It's been a month.

It won't happen again. Sure. Will you do that for me? Bea? \n \n \n \n    (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n \n Fuck! Give me homicide. Javier Abad. - It's me, Javier. Is Santiago there? - He just left. How's that hangover? You were shit-faced when you left us at one. I came straight home. Hey, I'm a bit late, we were at the doctor. Beatriz isn't well. We weren't expecting you anyway. Santiago took Pablo. Why? What's going on? Must be the heat. Some guy got chopped up in a hair salon. - Is Santiago here? - Yeah, inside. Javier. Why are you here? I thought you'd be in bed. - No, I went home early. - Shit, boss. You should let us handle it. You're pale as hell. - Hangover? - A little, yeah. What happened? The cleaning lady found it. But she freaked and won't talk. The owner is on his way over. Looks pretty routine. I thought you were leaving. Yeah, the chief just wants me to supervise. You know, typical bullshit. You're the boss, it's your case. I'll just say I had a look. - Hello. - Excuse me. Javier! His name is Jose Miguel Mart?n Duque. Inspector... the owner of the salon. - Santiago Mora, homicide. - What happened? H-50, Inspector Abad. We need a check on a Jose Miguel Mart?n Duque. ID number 30554321. Thank you. - Do you know Jose Miguel Mart?n? - Mickey. Yeah. He worked here for a while. Why? He's been murdered. The lock wasn't forced. He'd stopped working here, but he still had his key. Why? Because we were friends. Sometimes we'd meet here for a drink after work. What does that mean? Was he a homosexual? You aren't obliged to respond, for now. But it would be helpful. Yeah, he was gay. He brought guys sometimes. His sister's flat is so small. Did he bring guys here often? I don't know, sometimes. - Was he into drugs, prostitution? - No way. No way, I swear. Do you have any idea of what may have happened? He was normal. He'd never hurt anyone. Any more information? He worked in a pub. The night-shift. He'd get off around 2, 2:30. 2, 2:30. Where is this pub? Yes? Jose Miguel Mart?n Duque. 29 years old, born in Segovia. No prior record. - I overheard. Let's check the pub. - Look, Javier. Don't be upset, but... I'd rather not have you along. Why? You saw the owner, and the victim... same stuff. We've got a lot of drag here, and I don't want you near it. That was back when I was drinking. Don't label me a \"faggot-hater\" because of it. I'm not. - Of course not. - Fine, I don't like them. But I've got nothing to hide. You know my transfer goes through next week. I don't want people there to pass judgment on me. Fine, don't be so dramatic. He lived with his sister, right? Go ahead. Theater offers life in pieces. Choose your favorite, or one you'd like to change. Every one of you has a dramatic story to tell, or a wonderful comedy. Later we'll choose one and we'll stage it. You'll prepare the set, select wardrobe, and do the acting. And you'll do it for an audience. Alicia Mart?n? Excuse me a moment. I'm Police Inspector Javier Abad. What's this about? Your brother's... dead. Murdered? Who is the bastard? We're trying to find out. You were here last night? Until 2, maybe 2:30. I usually keep watch while Mickey serves drinks, but... He left with a guy sitting over there. It's not like we're a sex club or anything. Sometimes Mickey's friends came to see him. Fags, - but no drugs. - And this guy he left with... Did anyone recognize him? What did he look like? I didn't get a good look. He was wearing a suit. He looked like a polar bear. A light-colored suit. - Was he drinking? - Yeah, vodka tonics. Desperately, with both hands, like from a fountain. - What time did he come? - I'd say around 1:30. And around 2:30 he left with the client. I didn't pay much attention. The only thing is... Well, no offense, Mr. Policeman... No, go on. Mickey said the guy was a cop. That he'd never been with a cop before... but it may not be true. I wouldn't recommend it. I always told him not to do that. Because of the roaches. Would you like coffee? No, thank you. I'm going to make some anyway. I need to do something. Did my brother suffer? Don't think about that. What should I think about? The weather? If you really want to help, tell us anything you know, or can imagine, or suspect... I don't know. You lived with him. Don't hold out on us. My brother wasn't a criminal. That's not what I meant. Excuse me, but... What are you after? I saw your brother did quite a bit of traveling. He never saved money. He spent everything he made. Gifts, trips... You know. Not very bright, but... the best person I've ever known. I'd have been lost without him. We're from Segovia. Our parents are old and very traditional. I suppose we were a disappointment for them. A homosexual and a failed actress. Are they still alive? Mickey came here very young. And when my folks left Segovia, he brought me here for my career. He was convinced that I would be a hit. Until the motorcycle accident. They glued me back together again. Only he stayed by my side. If it weren't for my brother... Enough about me. Nothing I know will help you. Everyone liked Mickey and he stayed out of trouble. He even avoided love for fear that he'd get hurt. Don't cry, please. Don't cry. I promise whoever did this will pay. Here's my card. If you remember anything, or you want to talk, call me. - Hi, Javier. - Hello. I need a gift to make peace with my wife. Any ideas? I don't know. What's she like? Like you, but nastier. You could shoot yourself and leave her a widow. Maybe something less vulgar. How about a kiss? You don't usually come here straight from work. Beatriz, please. No more arguing. Not today. I thought we could have a drink. Santiago called to ask me where you were last night. I said you were with me. But... Santiago isn't stupid. What happened? Are you in trouble? No. All I know is I'm having the baby. With or without you. We've waited long enough. I'm 35 now, I can't wait any longer. Have you thought about it? He's going to be happy. With a normal father. Not some obsessed detective out to prove... Out to prove what? You know. No, sorry, but I don't. I was wrong. It's not the alcohol. It's you. Your father died in the asylum, not you. - But now you're exactly like him. - Shit, Beatriz. It was just a couple drinks. Fine, fine. I'm sorry. I don't even care about my career or my father right now. Then quit. I can't promise I'll forget it all and act like nothing happened, but I'll try. Quit tomorrow. For good. We don't need it. I can't. I can't, I need at least a few more days. Fine. Whatever you say. Just seeing you with that tie makes me want to smack you. It's to cover the marks your wife left. She went back to her first husband anyway. She used to cheat on him with me. - Now she cheats on me with him. - Women are evil. All the emergency services are down. This heat could kill people. Shall we get started? Show a little respect. Right, this is preliminary info, but it doesn't look good. The place was full of fingerprints from clients. The cleaning lady hadn't been in yet. So that's a dead end. The victim's fingernails show no blood nor fiber. - There are 14 wounds. - Shit. The deepest in his back. He was stabbed from behind and then in front. The murder weapon is a pair of scissors. They're gone, but can be easily recognized. They're gold, with a purple handle. A real flamer. Semen? No. There was no sexual contact. Penetration, at least. Looks like a real mess. Well, the easiest cases always look like this at the start. The kid led a normal life. A bit flaky, but a good kid. Robbery's out, because he had cash on him. The murderer didn't even look in his wallet. Looks like the work of an opportunist. Maybe a crime of passion, or someone who hated homosexuals. Like Javier. Pablo, I'm really gonna miss your sense of humor. Here's what we've got. The kid was last seen at work in the pub. Around 2, 2:30. He left with a client. No description, but wearing a suit. He'd been drinking. Vodka tonics. And he said - he was a cop. - Now we're fucked. That's unconfirmed. We know they left together and the trail ends there. Until the body is found at 9 AM. The victim entered the salon with someone for a drink. We don't know if it was the cop, or someone else. He only made two drinks. The coroner says he was killed around 3:30, or 4:00. No one heard anything, no one saw anything. No witnesses. The kid's folks just arrived. You spoke to his sister. Talk to them. See the list of calls? The last call he made was to his parents. They may know something. Do that for me. Okay, okay. Good morning. I'm Inspector Abad. We're on your son's case. I'm sorry for your loss. Do you know who did it? No. Not yet. But we don't think he was in any trouble. Were you in close contact with him or your daughter? To me, my son died a long time ago. Ages ago. When he was 17 I told him I'd had a son and not a... a freak. I told him to change, or I would change him. He left and we never saw him again. But yesterday you spoke to him on the phone. - Did he sound worried? - Yes. He called me. I didn't want to mention it. What for? She's ill. And what did you talk about for... seven minutes? Forgive the question, but I have to know. He asked me for money. For his sister. For another operation. But we don't have any money. Only the house. Where would we live without it? That boy took everything. Our daughter, our lives, everything. I'm almost glad he's dead. Don't say that, ma'am. People liked your son. Then why is he dead? Another thing. It's about your daughter. I don't know, maybe she needs help. She knows where to find us. Yeah, that's him all right. He was out there this morning. He was hanging out by the salon. - Are you absolutely sure? - Yes. You saw him come out? Well, not exactly come out. I saw him in front. He must have come out. - The other one was scarier. - That's him. Believe me, I saw him. Drunk, staggering back and forth, looking for his car or something. I keep close watch on the salon at night. Nothing against those boys, you understand, but anyway... You know what I mean. He can't see me, can he? Relax. That's all for now. The judge will call you to testify. I won't be here tomorrow. I'm leaving. You can keep the house and all the rest. I don't need you. And stay away from my child. Spare him all your crap. Very well. - Where are the others? - With a witness. We finally found someone who saw it all. Santiago's with her. This is Mrs. Natalia Delgado. She saw our man. Please, continue. It was too hot to sleep. I went out on the balcony for a little air. The hair salon's right in front. I saw him come out. I try to stay out of other people's affairs, but it was late. He caught my attention. What did he look like? Young, with his hair shaved short, with braids and a goatee. He had a tattoo on his shoulder. I would say he was gay. I almost called the police, in case he was a thief. But I didn't. Well, your description is a great help. About what time was this? I'm not sure, but... around 5 or 6 AM. My husband was still sleeping. I don't smoke. What the hell is she doing? You left something behind. A handkerchief with your initials. Covered in blood. Come over this afternoon. - Thank you, Mrs. Delgado. - You're welcome. Your testimony was a great help. We'll call you. Well, this simplifies things. If she checks out, of course. - Can you imagine a wife like that? - You're drooling. Javier, telephone. The stiff's sister. - How can you like that scarecrow? - She goes out of her way. Looks like a gay lovers' quarrel. Yeah. And you've no idea how happy that makes me. Yesterday a witness placed you at the scene of the crime. Drunk, wearing a suit. - What are you saying? - Not me. The owner of the restaurant in front. Though his testimony is inconsistent. But this lady has it straight. You hear her testimony? Do you really think I could be involved? You tell me. I told you, I was at home with Beatriz. So she says. But I know you, and how you get when you drink. I know you didn't go home. - Don't be a jerk. - Javier. Were you the cop with the kid in the bar? Just tell me that. I have one thing to say. If you want to question me, arrest me. Why not? I once hit a fag, I must be guilty. Hey, take it easy. That's not what I said. But if you're involved at all, even something stupid, tell me. Go to hell. Have it your way. Hello? Inspector Javier Abad? It's Alicia Mart?n. - I need to talk to you. - I'm not handling the case. I prefer to talk to you. Not necessarily as a cop. Just a little while. All right. I'll drop by after your classes. Thank you. Thank you very much. Do you have to get all dressed up like this? Hello again. Cut the crap. Where's the handkerchief? In a safe place. We can give it to the cops, or to you. What do you want? Money. - What money? I'm a cop, I'm broke. - And those suits? The car? Of course you have money. If not, find some. You've committed a murder, and you'll pay for it. You can pay us part now... - Where is it? - Don't tell him! Give it to me! I'll crush his bones! Not my little doggie! Here you go. Now you have it. Leave us. You fucking coward! - We won't tell anyone, I swear. - I will! I'll tell the police. - Natalia, please! - Don't be stupid. - I am the police. - He's right. My nails are broken! I didn't want to do this. We're not criminals. I don't know how I could... It's all I have. That's all? My husband earns more. How did I get here that night? Natalia found you downstairs in the street. My wife disappears sometimes, for a day or two. She always comes back. She's got problems - with stress. - Stress? He doesn't fuck me. So I look elsewhere. On the street. I saw you and brought you up. Another chump. You passed out right away. Where did you find me? In the salon? You don't even remember? - Was it in the salon? - No! In the street, drunk off your ass. But you were well-dressed and you said you were a cop. So I brought you upstairs. - What time was it? - I don't know, 5:30 or 6:00. I found the handkerchief the next day, covered in blood. That's when we realized. What? Now you'll say you didn't kill the fag. The perfect cop. A drunk, a murderer and a faggot. - Shut up! - You shut me up! There was a bum sleeping outside the salon. Ever seen him around? No, this has always been a quiet neighborhood. Until you stumbled along. - Hi, honey. - Hello. This heat will kill me before autumn. - You look lousy. Eating well? - Yeah. Give me an anisette. And make it strong. - What's that crap you're drinking? - Tonic with a little vodka. - You shouldn't drink that. - Drop it. - Here. - Look. Drinking is like marriage. Some are good at it, others fail miserably. - Yeah. Here. - Thanks. Hey, my drink! I need you to find a bum for me. He has a spot on his face and plays flute. He was sleeping in the Goya area two nights ago. - The spot sounds familiar. - This stays between us. Sure, honey. Those numbers will bring you luck someday, you'll see. How's your wife doing? Great. We're going to have a kid. What? I said keep your hands still. Where is it? I don't know. I can't hear you. I don't know what you mean. Please... Please, what? You lived with your brother, the guy steals a ton of money... And you don't know? My brother's dead. I don't know anything about any money. Money's difficult to hide. So don't bust my balls. What else can I say? What? Crippled and stupid? Are you stupid? You. Get lost. Hey. What's up? Looking to screw another sibling? Who the fuck was that guy? What money? You want my help? Then stop holding out on me! Do you know who did it? Just that it's my fault. Mickey was transporting money. I don't know how much or who for. Until one day he kept the shipment for one of my operations. He thought nobody would miss it, so he kept it. I told him to return it, but he wouldn't listen. He put it all in a red sporting bag and left with it two days ago. I never saw him again. Him or the money. But those guys are still after the money. They don't have it. I thought they'd killed him. But no. Someone killed Mickey and took the money. You want to eat something? I hate people seeing my legs. You're still very pretty. Yeah. My mother was right. I wish I'd been born ugly. It would be easier now. And Mickey might be here. Why did he do it? It's a huge risk to take. He was driving the motorcycle when I got hurt. Though he wasn't hurt. I suppose he felt guilty. Why didn't you tell me this before? Because I'm afraid of those people. They said if I told the police they'd come for me. And get what's theirs. How much is it? I don't know. I never saw it. But a lot. A lot. Have you got it? Why are you helping me? You bring me to your house... - What are you after? - You're free to leave. Where to? I wish I had that money. So I could turn it in. No one will find you here. I only come to sleep. Stay until we settle this. It's a lovely home. My wife has good taste. She just left me earlier today. If she knew there's already another woman in her bed... Well, half a woman. Yeah, hold on. Money? How much money? A lot. A sporting bag full of it. And it's clean money. Illegal. It can't be declared stolen. And it's up for grabs. How much for us? All of it. I just want the killer. The killer? Someone has that money. They took it from the salon and left an empty bag in my car. - They must know everything. - You... You were there. Yes. But I don't remember anything. What do you mean, you don't remember? Really? If you don't remember, then maybe you killed him. And lost the money. I don't know... Maybe. But I'm a cop, not a killer. That doesn't matter. What do we have to do? I was in the salon that night with the kid. That is certain. But I don't have the money. The red bag appeared in my car. Maybe it wasn't over the money. I'm sorry, we can't help you. There was someone else in the street. The bum. And a restaurant owner. He identified me at the station. One of them must know more. The schmuck from the restaurant. He's always watching everyone. I can't question him. - But you can. - It's not our business. Why should we help you? Here we go again. You fucking whimp! Do you think I want to be poor forever? You second-rate grocer! Where is everything you said we'd have? Where? I don't see it. Natalia, please be quiet. You don't have the balls to speak to me that way! Go to the kitchen. We don't need him at all. I know how to handle that nosy jerk from the restaurant. That's not really her. Not for a long time. Think what you will, but... She's the best thing that ever happened to me. You want to keep her? With money she'll stay. Can't you see my wife isn't well? She's seeing a psychiatrist, but when she gets like this, it's no use. Please. Leave us alone. I need your help. It wouldn't be dangerous. I've got much more at stake here. So I won't let her get hurt. Just think about the money. What would I have to do, exactly? An iced coffee. With this heat I'm going to close and take a few days off. This is unbearable. It's driving us all crazy. Like the crime in the salon. Yeah. And still no news. The cops came by our place to ask if we'd seen anything. They were in here, too. I even had to go down to the station. Did you see anything? The judge won't let me say. So, that means you saw who took the money. What money? Did you keep it? I don't know what you mean. Is this a joke? Sure, it's a joke. Anyway... I'm off. I don't know about the money. Wait, listen. Hey, wait up, please. This heat is disgusting! We can't talk here. It's me, Javier. Your things. This could take a while. You haven't eaten? No. - What's this? - A statement of everything I know. I had all morning to write it. Give it to the police. No. Why not? Alicia, this would make you the main suspect. Only you knew about the money. Right. Fine, I'll go to the police. You'll go straight to jail. And for a while, I hope. When you get out, those guys will be waiting. You want to get some air or eat something? Why are you helping me? It's not for you. I want to solve this case, and be promoted to chief. - Is that important? - Yes. For me it is. My father was a cop, too. A cop and an alcoholic. After destroying our lives, he fell for a young girl. He ended up getting kicked off the force. It isn't easy being a cop with a father like that. I want to prove I'm different. The drunk son of a bitch. I'm sorry. People with problems are a pain. Wait. I want to thank you. Mickey was all I had in this world. If it weren't for you... I don't know. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I suppose sleeping with a cripple goes beyond the call of duty. - And good taste. - It's not that. - Hello? - I found the guy with the spot. Where? Two nights ago you slept by a salon. Did you see me come out? Did you see me? I was sleeping. Don't bust my chops! - Did you? - Yes. - Was I alone? - No, with another guy. Who? I don't know, some guy. He dragged you to a car. The salon door woke me up. - Did he have a bag? - Yes. - Was it green? - No, red. - Where did he put it? - In the car. Then he went back in, and I fell asleep. - That's all I saw. - What was I doing? - You were passed out. - What was he like? Tall? Short? Young? - I didn't get a good look. - Sure. - But you saw something. - Well... He had on a checkered jacket with elbow patches. Did you see the killer? I was asleep, I swear. I didn't see anything. When he raises the blind that's the signal. That's when you go up. He must have the money. It must be him, right? I hope so. My penny-pinching days are over. I'm going to live it up, like before. I had it all when I was young. I was gorgeous. I almost got chosen as a spokes model for television, you know. I had a photo-shoot and everything. I could have been somebody, but I had no help. I've heard worse. Eight years with this man. He was a virgin, can you believe it? If I took off with that money right now, he would still love me. Everyone else always did whatever they wanted to me. Now it's my turn. - Who is it? - It's me, from the bar. Did you take the money? If you did you're an accomplice. Think about it. You, go home. I don't want any trouble. What'll you do to him? - You'll find out later. - Go home. Sit down. We went for the clown at the bar, too. But first... Well, you brought up the money... So you can spare us all the \"What money?\" bullshit. What's your angle? Look at me. We're paid to find the money. And to make whoever's got it pay. You're obviously someone's chump. You'll crack after one punch. Save yourself the trouble. I'll tell you whatever you want. I don't want the money, or anything. They made me do it. Can I open the window? It's hot in here. It's gonna get hotter. I don't know anything. The cop sent me. I told you. - He has the money. - No, he doesn't. How do you know? Stop looking around or I'll knock one of your fucking teeth out. What about you and the cop? Nothing. He met... He met me... - the day of... - Keep lying, that's it. Who met who? He met me that night. He won't last 5 punches. Not even three. Look, buddy. - Which finger first? - No. God damn it. We'll change questions. Who else knows about the money? The cop, you, and who else? - Shit, I'm suffocating. - Stay still. Who else fucking knows? Nobody. You'll fucking wish you were nobody. What are you going to do? First talk. I've been waiting 20 minutes. Who are those guys that were with you? Who are they? Please, I didn't do anything. They made me tell them what I know. I'm not involved in this. I just want to be left alone. Where are they? Close the restaurant. Good idea, coming to see him. Look who showed up. Hey, it's the man of all tastes! Look, this guy is a policeman. I don't care what you're all up to. But I want you to leave. Whatever you say. But you were just an accomplice to a murder. I'd think it over. I was hoping we'd get a chance to talk. How did it go? Not in the face. Don't leave any marks. You killed a man. As soon as a witness identifies you, you're screwed. You know what happens to cops in prison, don't you? If you told us where the money is... I don't have it. Yes, you do. Of course you do. You must. I saw you with him in the bar that night. I saw you leave together. - So cut the crap. - You were the only one with him. No. There was someone else. Oh, yeah? Who? A witness. - I don't believe that. - Tough shit. You won't kill me. We will if you don't give us the money. I won't do it. I'm not killing any cops. - I'll do it. - There you go. This is too complicated. What if someone else has the money? This fucker must have it. You said you saw us that night. You could have done it. Shut up or I'll kill you! When I heard you were a cop, I came straight back. - He's making all this up. - Then why'd you harass the cripple? - What's your fucking problem? - Enough! I know this guy and I trust him. But this asshole cop only wants to save his own ass. You have ten seconds to tell me. One... - I don't have it. - Too bad. Two... Three... A bum saw it all. Four... I didn't come out alone. Five... There was a guy with me. He had the bag, the one the kid had put the money in. Six... He had on a checkered jacket with elbow patches. - I don't have a jacket like that. - Seven! The bum saw him leave the empty bag and murder weapon in my car, and take the money. - Eight... - Wait, wait. No, I won't wait. You think I won't shoot you? That's quite a story. I don't believe it. Nine... Fucking wait! Killing cops is serious shit! Okay, all right. Spare me the good-cop, bad-cop routine. Go ahead and shoot. I haven't got it. Hold him still. It'll look like a suicide. Wait! This changes things. We'll see if you're lying or not. Let him go. You, relax. I know what I'm doing. Javier? It's Santiago. Pick up. I've been trying to find you all day. Pick up the damn phone! You can't be asleep. Fine, then listen. I knew something was up when I saw you at the hair salon. And I want you to tell me about it. You know something. I don't know what. Let me help you. Don't force me to interrogate you. You look like shit. And now what? I was thinking about last night. I have a proposal for you. We bring illegal immigrants into the country. You said you had the murder weapon. You can pin it on a foreigner. Blame it all on one of them and nobody will give a shit. We'll find you one. In exchange for the money. I told you I don't have it. We'll see about that. No funny stuff! Please wait, we haven't opened yet. What are you doing? It's okay, Beatriz. Leave right now or I'll call the police! - She's pregnant! - I'll kill them both! What's going on? Relax, we won't hurt you if your husband cooperates. Javier... What do you want me to say? I don't have the money. She doesn't know anything. We've separated. You'd let your wife and kid pay your debts for you? Javier, please. Give them the money, please. Stop! All right. All right. So you do know where it is. You see? The deal we just made. There is no deal anymore. I need to blame someone. I won't go to prison. Half tomorrow, the other half when they arrest the immigrant. No tricks. Or you can just keep killing people. All right. But none of this 24-hour stuff. Right now. I can't get that much cash right now. It's in a secret account. I see you're clever. This'll keep you in line. - How is she? - Fine. It didn't affect the baby. It was just a scare. Thank God it was nothing. You want a ride? No. My dad's on his way. He shouldn't see you. He was right about you. \"It's in the blood.\" Some guys went in the shop. You think I'm stupid? Talk to me. Beatriz told me. You weren't home and you told her to lie. And today. Who are those guys? What money? - A gambling debt. - Don't bust my balls! Just tell me one thing. Did you kill him? Right. Want to see something? The witness who got you off. She tried to kill herself. Her husband's dead. He fell from a third-story window and showed signs of torture. You don't know anything about it? Javier, it's two murders now. You taught us to solve every case. This case is like all the others. We'll catch the killer, whoever it is. Hopefully tomorrow... Of course. Tomorrow at 9 A.M. Before the judge. Your badge and gun. Is this what you were so afraid of? Great, you finally pulled it off. - Your gun. - Not my gun. - Don't bust my balls. - You're busting mine! - It's my gun, I bought it. - You want me to arrest you? Thanks, Javier. You'll make me look like a genius. You'd better be there tomorrow at nine. Wear clean clothes. You'll be spending the night. Where were you all night? People left messages telling you to go to the hospital. I didn't know what to do. I was worried about you. No, it was my wife. She's all right. What are you doing? - I'm leaving. - Why? What's wrong? You're up to something. Wait. Get in, please. What do you know? You know who did it? Alicia. Someone else must know about the money. They must. If you know who it is, for God's sake, tell me. What's going on? There's a witness. He saw two men come out of the salon. One took the money. And the other? The other was me. I was with your brother. But I don't know what happened. I was too drunk to remember. I can't handle this anymore. I can't take it. I don't know if I killed him. I only feel pain and guilt. As if I'd done it. You? It had to be you! I can help you, Alicia. - You don't understand... - Don't touch me! Son of a bitch. Murderer. How can you always wear a tie in this heat? What's up, asshole? Didn't have the money? That's disgusting. Not in the swimming pool! You see how talking helps? We have the perfect guy to pin it on. Some Romanian fuck. No papers and a record. I'll tell you where, you plant the scissors on him. And the case is closed. I don't see what's funny about this. I called the police. They'll be here in 5 or 10 minutes. Really? What'll you say? You killed the fag after you stole the money? I don't have the money. There was someone else there who took it. Which means it has to be one of you. I don't care about the money. I just want to know who! Don't you see he's serious? Let's go already. Kill that fucker. Go ahead! Get the car, quick! Drop the gun, fat boy. Drop it! What's wrong with you? This whole mess is all your fault! The money's our only way out. He doesn't have it, so it must be one of you. It doesn't matter. We have to leave. Nobody moves till I see the money! Fat boy?s too stupid, so it must be you. Or you, asshole. The cops are coming! Take me to a hospital. - Have you got the money? - No! I need a doctor! That's what I thought. I don't know who has it. - Who killed the kid? - Not us, I swear! We were here that night. The fat guy came back when you got there. It's a lot of money. It could have been anyone. Have you any news about my boy? You're bleeding. What's going on? The day before he died your son called. You said he asked for money. But he had tons of it. You lied to me. Why? Why? I called. Not Mickey. I called to tell him about the money and about Mickey. I lied to hide it from my mother. So she wouldn't find out. Why are you here? Stop looking for the killer. You're him. You killed my brother! I hope you rot in prison! You... You have the money? What? There's a witness. A bum who slept by the salon. He saw me come out. With a man in a checkered jacket with elbow patches. Did you kill him? - Or did you? - No. - Not her. It was me. - Dad! It's no use, Alicia. There's no other way. It's better this way. I can't live like this. Alicia told me about the money. And that Jose wanted to return it. He was afraid. What about me? When Jose met you and found out you were a cop, he took you to the salon to confess, turn the money in, and wash his hands of it. But you were so drunk you passed out. Then we arrived. We tried to convince Jose, but he wouldn't listen. You were out cold. You killed him over money? Over everything! My brother destroyed my parents' lives, and mine! He did this to me. And he wanted to return the money. No way! He had to pay somehow. For everything he did to us. I killed him. Yes. It was my idea. And I'd do it again. You made me look guilty. He had to pay for what he did to us, Mom. Arrest me. I took the money, and I put the scissors in your car. I'll say whatever you want. But don't hurt my baby anymore. She's been hurt enough.", "url": "https://subslikescript.com/movie/X-326430"},

You were sick when you were my age. Evening, sir. Evening, Victor. I didn't realize you were still here. I was just keeping James company, sir, if that's alright. Very kind of you. Any better, Son?

Get off me! I told you never to come back here. Get out! James? No. James? There are things you don't understand. Don't. I need him to know! Please don't. No more lies. James, No! James! He... He wasn't your father, Son. What are you? I didn't mean it! I didn't mean it! Yes, you did! He deserved it, and you gave it to him. We're brothers, Jimmy. You realize that? And brothers protect each other. Yes we're hard now, hard so nothing can ever touch us. I want to go home. We can't. We stick together, no matter what, and take care of anyone who gets in our way. Can you do that, little brother? I'm going down to the river. They're coming. Head over the hill. Can you run? Hurry! Keep on running. Don't look back. Ok. Back to back! That's enough! Enough! No! No! Stand down, soldier! Victor! Stand down! Stand down! Stand down! No! Ready. Aim. Wake me when it's over. Fire! Freaks! You're animals! Freaks! My name is Major William Stryker. You've been charged with killing a senior officer. Is that correct? Apparently, we have some issues with authority, Just keep a lid on it. Sir. The warden tells me that your sentence was carried out by a firing squad at 1000 hours. How'd that go? It tickled. You boys tired of running? Tired of denying your true nature? What do you care? I care. I care because I know how special you are. How valuable. Look, you can stay here, locked up like freaks of nature, or you can join me. I'm putting together a special team, with special privileges. Now tell me, how would you like to really serve your country? You know, I love this weapon more than any other thing in the whole wide world. Do you wanna know why? No. It's memorable. Sure, it's a little bulky, tough to get on a plane. You whip out a couple of swords at your ex-girlfriend's wedding, they will never, ever forget it. That's funny, Wade. I think you confuse me with someone who gives a shit. Right it's, it's probably not as intimidating as having a gun or bone claws or the fingernails of a bag lady. Manicure? Victor. Easy. Fred got a new tattoo. I'm concerned. Jesus Fred, you just met her last night. I love her. You love her after one night? She's a gymnast. Bradley, take her down. God. Are you gonna puke? If we were meant to fly, we'd grow wings. Don't worry, Nancy. More people die driving than flying. How about from impaling? Hey, be nice, or be your approximation of nice. Would you like a bucket? Gentlemen, wheels down in Lagos in five. Why are we here? All in good time. Zero? Intruder! Perimeter breach! Man the weapon! Intruder, stop! Put your hands behind your head! Having fun yet? Fred? The tank? The tank. Yeah, I got that. Great. Stuck in an elevator with five guys on a high-protein diet. Wade. Dreams really do come true. Just shut it! You're up next. Thank you, sir. You look really nice today. It's the green. It brings out the seriousness in your eyes. Oh my God. Do you ever shut up, pal? No. Not when I'm awake. Bradley? Top floor, please. Cover the elevator! The elevator! Time to go to work. Ok. People are dead. If you didn't have that mouth on you Wade, you'd be the perfect soldier. I would not do that if I was you, brother. Take the diamonds. They're yours. I don't want your diamonds. I want this. But, that is nothing. A souvenir. Where did you find it? I want the source. A small village, far inland, three days from here. Tell him this rock is more valuable to me than his life. Ask him where he found it. Ok. He says it came from the sky. He's telling the truth. You don't know the language, Logan. It's a meteor fragment. I know what it is. I'm asking him where he found it. Sir, base wants to know our location. Shut them down. Yes. Tell him everyone here will die unless he tells me where he found the rock. He says that it's sacred. Ok, fine. Victor. Victor! Don't even think about it. We didn't sign up for this. Put him down! What are you doing? We finally got a good thing going here. Don't you screw this up. Enough. That's enough. We've done enough. Who do you think you are? This is what we do. Maybe you'd rather be rotting in a hole somewhere Till they figure out a way to do it to us. Is that it? I'm done. You coming? Jimmy! We can't just let you walk away. Jimmy! Jimmy! Why are you up so early? Come here. See you, baby. Hey. That's nice. Yes. Take your time. You're wrapped, man. Ok, I'm totally gonna get this. Nope. Come on. Let's go on the Ferris wheel. How does he do it? Come on. Amazing lady in a box! Swing the hammer, ring the bell! Hey, what do you do? If you turn off the light, you win a prize. Three tries for a buck. Come on, I wanna do it. There you go. Ok? No, that's obvious. That's two. Well, that's a stupid trick. It's not a trick, man. Come on. Freak. Bye. Show's over! I said, show's over! The show's never over for us, Bradley. Victor. Aren't you gonna invite me in? Yeah. Come on in. You know, I've never said anything, to anyone, about what happened. I'm living a totally different life now, Victor. No need to bring up the past. You know, I always thought it would be Wade, to come knocking at my door. Well... Well... Wade's gone. I'm not afraid of you, Victor. I'm not afraid of dying. How do you know? You've never tried it before. Was it the wars? Which one? All of them. Tell me. Hey. It's just a scratch. Looks like we're gonna need new sheets again, baby. Yeah. Who the hell is this? Smells like government. My God. Haven't aged a day! Clean living. You remember Agent Zero? Still shooting first, asking questions later? You still chewing on cheap cigars? Boys, please. I have a job for you. I already have a job. Lumberjack? 18 grand a year? 18.5. Plus I haven't had to kill anyone in a while. Starting to miss it? Right about now I am. Yeah? Zero, back to the car. Attaboy. You know, I'm not proud about the way things ended between us. Conversation's over. Playing Little House on the Prairie with a... schoolteacher, I mean, that just isn't you, Logan. And you would know? I would. What do you want, Stryker? Bradley was killed three days ago. Wade before that. I believe that someone is hunting down our old team. Anyone else? As far as I know, Victor is safe. But whoever it is has, names, addresses. I can take care of myself. This is not about you, Logan. Your country needs you. I'm Canadian. I know you, Logan! I know who you are! Miss Kayla, Miss Kayla, look what I did. What did you do? Bye, Miss Silverfox! Bye! What's wrong? Stryker came by today. Don't worry. I said no. Why is he bothering you after all these years? Because I'm the best there is at what I do, but what I do best isn't very nice. You're not an animal, Logan. What you have is a gift. A gift. You can return a gift. Come on, fellas. Alright. Stay in the car. I'm just gonna ask nicely. You mind letting us go by? You in some kind of a hurry there, pal? Hey, hey, hey. Are you? Just move your truck so we can go by. We're trying to have a conversation there, alright? You start something, you'd better be ready to finish it. Listen, Hey, guys, take it easy! Calm down. Your boyfriend's got a big mouth. I know. Big temper, too. So please let us pass. Thank you. Come on, man, let's go. How'd you do that? Female powers of persuasion. It's a gift. I see. Do you have those powers over me? Well, you didn't stay in the car, did you? Why is the moon so lonely? Why? Because she used to have a lover. You tell this to the kids? No. His name was Kuekuatsheu and they lived in the Spirit World together. This is a true story? Alright. And every night they would wander the skies together, but... one of the other spirits was jealous. Trickster wanted the moon for himself, so he told Kuekuatsheu that the moon had asked for flowers. He told him to come to our world and pick her some wild roses, but Kuekuatsheu didn't know that once you leave the Spirit World, you can never go back. And every night, he looks up in the sky, and sees the moon and howls her name. But... he can never touch her again. Koo-koo-ka-choo got screwed. Kuekuatsheu. It means the Wolverine. What you doing, Logan? Kayla. God. Kayla! You're not from around here, are you? What gave me away? Victor! You got insurance on this place? Insurance? No. Too bad. Victor! Well, well, well. Look what the cat dragged in. Guys, whatever this is, take it outside. Why? Why? You don't call. You don't write. How else am I supposed to get your attention? I hate to say it Jimmy but... frankly I'm a little disappointed. Stay down. Tell me something, Jimmy. Was she worth it? When are you gonna figure it out? We're not like them. I am nothing like you. Sure, you are. You just don't know it yet. What do we got? Bar fight. Multiple knife wounds. What is this, a joke? Guy's fine. Where is he? Hey, hey, don't, I said, where is he? I don't know who he is. I can help you. Six years I've been here. No one knew me and then you show up, and the next day she's dead! I tried to warn you. Why didn't you tell me it was Victor? I didn't know! Bullshit! Why? I swear on my son's life, I didn't! Victor's appetites were becoming too public. I had to lock him up. He felt I betrayed him. Went AWOL. He said he was coming after all of us. You didn't come to warn me, you came to save your own ass. So what's your plan, Captain? You can't beat him, Logan, you know you can't! I'm gonna find him and kill him. I can give you the tools to defeat him. And we can still save the others. You mean save yourself, right? I promise you two things. You will suffer more pain than any other man can endure, but you will have your revenge. I come with you, I'm coming for blood. No law. No code of conduct. You point me in the right direction, you get the hell out of my way. When it starts, whatever the reason is that you're doing this, focus on that. Maybe it will help. Trust me, I've been through worse. No, you haven't. We're ready. We're gonna make you indestructible, but first, we're gonna have to destroy you. You remember what we were looking for in Africa? I remember. Well, I found it. It helped us create a... metal compound so strong, that you will be able to withstand virtually anything. It's called, Adamantium. I can't put Victor down myself, Logan. To kill him, you're gonna have to embrace the other side. Become the animal. Let's do this. I almost forgot. I want new ones. What do you want them to say? Wolverine. Generals, welcome. General Munson. Today we're gonna witness medical history. Today we're gonna create... Weapon X. X? Roman numeral, 10. We are about to begin bonding Adamantium to Weapon X's skeleton. Let's begin. We're brothers, Jimmy. Logan! Body temperature, 108 and rising. Why is he thrashing like that? Why isn't he sedated? He feels pain just like the rest of us, but anesthesia won't work on him. That's why he had to volunteer. Heart rate, 190. 195. Will he survive this? I don't know. 200. Son. Heart rate well beyond maximum. Blood pressure? 260 over 180 and rising. He can make it. He can make it. Victor! I love you. You're not an animal. It means the Wolverine. Well, I guess he can die. Come on, old friend. Come back. Heart rate rising. Adamantium reservoir is depleted. No rejection. Procedure completed. We did it. We did it. Yeah! Yes. Are we taking him to the island? The island? No. The bonding works. We'll use his DNA for the XI. Erase his memory. Erase his memory. I think he heard you. Lock down! Hunt him down. Take his head off. Travis. I think there is a naked man in the barn. Yep. Son? What in hell you doing? It's cold. Cold. You got no clothes on. Yeah. You're not on the drugs, are you? No. No, just had a rough night. Yeah, you could say that. Come on up to the house. Some of my son's old clothes will probably fit you. Here. Cover it up with that? I don't want you giving the old lady a heart attack. You alright in there? Yeah, yeah, I'm fine! Supper's on the table. Yeah, I'll be there in a minute. I swear, I'm gonna pay for it. Set it down over there. Right. Come and sit down, son. I can't thank you both enough, for everything. It would not have been decent to leave you out there to freeze. Decent. What? Nothing. I'm just not really used to that word. That's a nice chopper you've got out there. You know motorcycles? Lord, here we go. My favorite's a '48 Panhead. Bought one new off the line. I think you're a little young for that, son. You must be exhausted. You get a good night's sleep. In the barn. Nothing you can break out there. Why is the moon so lonely? Why? Because she used to have a lover. He can never touch her again. You sleep ok? Yeah. You look like a man fixing to do a bad thing. You know what happens to men who go looking for blood? What? They find it. We all got a choice, son. Yeah, well, mine got taken. Bullshit. This was my son's jacket. Try it on. Thank you. Yep. You want to take my bike for a spin? Test the suspension? '64? Man, you're heavy. Yeah, I put on a little weight recently. Good morning! Good morning. It fits you beautifully. I brought you some... Weapon X is in the barn. He's just murdered two civilians. Blow him to bits. Let's see if he can survive that. Come get me. Blow his brains all over the road! Damn it! Alpha one, do not lose him! Alpha two! Target coming to you! Pull up! Pull back! Pull back! Zero? Zero, come in. Zero? Zero, is Logan dead? I don't know. I'm down. Zero, is he dead? Is Logan dead? Zero, come in. You tried to kill me. Logan? Where's Victor? Come back to base. I'll explain everything. We'll take Victor down together. Wrong answer. After I kill Victor, I'm coming for you. Logan, listen to me. If you go down this road, you're not gonna like what you find. You wanted the animal, Colonel. You got it. Those were good people back there. Innocent people. It's funny how good, innocent people tend to die around you. Zero never stood a chance. The only thing that'll take him down is an Adamantium bullet. This facility's compromised. Prep transport. Colonel, this is turning into a disaster. Don't worry. We'll stop him. Really? You just spent half a billion dollars, making him indestructible. Sir? Yes? The young mutant you've been looking for. We've found him. General, Logan isn't the only piece of this puzzle. I need to evacuate this facility. Please go back to Washington. We've got work to do. Yo hablo, I talk. Tú hablas, you talk. Él habla, somebody translate. Summers! Sit up and take off those glasses. I have a headache. Then you can wear them in detention after school while you write out this conjugation 100 times. Somebody else? He talks. Thank you. He talks. Él habla. You sure it was Victor? Yeah. Damn. I'm sorry, man. What the hell happened to him after I left? He got worse. He felt like you abandoned him. Hell, we all did. But Victor, he had to prove he was better than you. Hunting and killing everything he was pointed at. Quit a few months later myself. Couldn't take rounding them up. Rounding who up? Leave it alone. Rounding who up, John? Hey! Damn it, John! We hunted our own kind, Logan. There's a special place in hell for the things we did. Mutants? Why? Stryker said we'd be making a difference, protecting people from the bad ones. How are you gonna take Victor down, Logan? Remember that stuff in Africa? Yeah, I remember Africa. What about it? Damn. What'd they do to you, man? Don't ask. Listen, Zero said something about an island. Does that mean anything to you? Nope. But maybe Dukes knows. Him and Zero were real tight. Fred Dukes? Where is he? He's here. Well, let's go talk to him. Hold on. He don't get in till around 4:00. But I got to warn you, he developed a bit of an eating disorder. We all got our coping mechanisms. I'm trying to whup him back into shape. Whatever you do, don't mention his weight. Come on, Fred, if you wanna get in shape, you got to move, man. I told him he got to move. He's got to move! What? Fred Dukes? That looks like the creature that ate Fred Dukes. Hey, be nice, man. Hey, fat, Fred. I seem to remember that girl when she was about 85 pounds? That's funny. You're still so funny, Logan. You know where Victor is? No idea. What's the island, slim? Don't let the door hit you on the way out, Logan. Listen, I ain't leaving here till you tell me where Victor is. So come on, bub, for old times' sake? Did you just call me... Blob? No but... I told you not to mention his weight. Why'd you call him Blob? I didn't call him Blob. I said bub. God damn it. Hey, hey, hey. Hey, Logan. I got an idea. This is your idea of an idea? I'm trying to help you out, Logan. Dukes don't like you that much and you know it. Yeah, the feeling's mutual. Well, use them gloves, man. Dance with him a little bit. Allow him to let his anger out on you. Figure if you do that, he'll probably tell you everything you want to know. Come on, man, look at him. Got a big old ass coming out the front of his shirt. Jesus. He's gonna have a coronary, for Christ's sake. Is there even a stretcher big enough to take this guy out of here? It ain't him I'm worried about getting out of here on a stretcher. You're an asshole. Come on, Logan. Whup his ass! You want it? Dance with him, Fred! Just like I taught you. You want to dance with me? Come on, Fred! Oh! That feels good. Hey! Guess what? See, he gonna talk now. You got him right where you want him. Whose side are you on, anyway? Come on! Come on now lamb chop! Damn! Now, where's Victor? Little dark for sunglasses, don't you think? Please, don't! Please, don't! Victor! Hey, hey! Where's Victor? Yeah. Victor is... with Stryker on the island. They... They run it together. What? They what? Victor will be with Stryker? Yeah. You didn't know that? All that's left now is Logan. I trust you can handle that. I did before, didn't I? Oh yes. You did that. Our deal. It still applies, right? Of course. Now bag him and tag him, Captain. What's the island? It's where Stryker takes them after Victor's caught them. Wait, hang on a minute. Takes who? Mutants. Rumor is that... Stryker's doing experiments on them there. I mean, you never wondered what happened to them? I tried not to. They killed her so I'd let them put Adamantium in me. They killed her for a goddamn experiment. Where is it? Where is it? Logan, Stryker kept it real secret. But, a prisoner escaped there once. Who? His name was Remy LeBeau. He was a street hustler from New Orleans. The guards at the prison called him Gambit because he kept taking all their money at poker. That's all I know. What's Stryker up to, Fred? What's the endgame? He's taking their powers. Trying to combine them somehow. That's all I know, Logan. That's all I know. If I have to come back here, I'm gonna take your head off. I'm coming with you, Logan. There's no redemption where I'm going. I ain't asking. There's our dude. That's cool. I'm gonna go cover the back in case he rabbits. I'm not gonna fight with him. Yeah, right. What? I get in fights with everybody? Don't dogs kill cats? Just go cover the back, will you? Give me 500. I'm in. Are you Remy LeBeau? Do I owe you money? No. Then Remy LeBeau I am. Large blind's 100. Small blind's 50. May I deal you in? What can I get for 17 bucks? $17? A cab ride home, perhaps? You my brother's new babysitter, John? I ain't Bradley, Victor. And your creepy black coat don't scare me. Really? Worked on Dukes. You should not have done that, because now I'm gonna kill you before Logan even gets a chance. So what brings you to our fair city, sir? Victor Creed. And who's that? The man I'm gonna kill. He works with a man named Stryker on... an island. Just need to know where it is. And why would you think I know that? Well, because I know who you are, Gambit. You're the guy who escaped and you're the guy who's gonna take me back there. You know John, there is something I always wanted to tell you. You're predictable. I can feel your spine, Johnny Boy. That's funny. Never knew you had one. Those are mighty nice tags you have on there, sir. The men who took me wore tags just like them. Hey, now bub, you listen to me. Damn it. That little... Two years I rotted in that hellhole and I ain't never going back... Shiny. Tell me something, Jimmy. Do you even know how to kill me? I'm gonna cut your goddamned head off. See if that works. You're getting slow, old man. You son of a bitch. You're gonna die for what you did to her. Victor! Well, that's a nice stick. Ok, shithead, here's the deal. See, you're gonna take me to this island, where I can kill Creed, Stryker and pretty much everyone you hate in this world. Do you understand? You're really gonna kill them? As long as you stay out of my way, yeah. Colonel? General? Is this Weapon XI? All their strengths and none of their weaknesses. You really hate them, don't you? No, I don't hate them. After 20 years of working with mutants, I just know what they can do. We can win this war before it starts and save countless lives in the process. Pre-emptive action is the only action here, General. The days of our country sitting on the sidelines are over. We need to take the fight to the enemy before they take the fight to us. I admire your passion, I do. Thank you. But this is as far as it goes. Weapon X was a hiccup. We know about your son, Bill. We know he's a mutant, and we know he killed your wife. You should not have kept that from us. That... That has nothing to do, with my work, General. Bullshit. You're too close to this. I'm shutting you down. Ok. You're right. I won't lie to you. My son... did bring the problem home for me, but I took an oath, to protect the American people, from every threat, both foreign... and domestic. You don't like flying? I'm fine. Just concentrate on what you're doing. You sure? You got a bit of sweat on your brow there. Very funny. Just keep your eyes on the... On the what? The clouds? Keep my eyes on the clouds? You're up and down like a freaking yo-yo here! Where'd you get this thing, anyway? This is my baby. I won her in a game. Jacks over fives. Great. Relax. We're almost there. There it is. The island. Three Mile Island. Hiding in plain sight. No one's gonna snoop around a nuclear reactor. They think it's gonna turn them into freaks. Like you? Right. Alright. You ready? Because it's now or never. Let's go. About time. Hey, if it makes you feel any better, this is really gonna hurt. Well, yeah, it kind of does, actually. Good luck. Likewise. Shit. How you doing? Everything alright? Is he ready yet? A few more hours. And he will respond to my commands? Absolutely. Logan. Welcome back to the war. Before I gut you, I want to know why. I needed your powers for the Pool. For the what? The mutant killer. Deadpool. Years of searching and refining, finding the right powers that can... coexist in one body without ripping it apart. My son, was the first piece of the puzzle. Logan, you were the last. You made Weapon XI possible. I asked you to help, but... you said you wanted the quiet life. Well, I've learned that nothing motivates, the men in your family like revenge. Who are you? She's real, old friend. Did you really think we'd just let you walk away? You're a dangerous man. We like to keep an eye on dangerous men. Tell him about the day you died. They gave me a shot of hydrochlorothiazide. It reduces the heart rate so low it appears you flatlined. Don't be angry with her. She's a real credit... to your species. Did you know that her sister has diamond-hard skin? Kayla's mutation is tactohypnosis. She can influence people as long as she touches them. Quite a useful tool in a seduction. It was never real, my friend. It was real for me. I told you if you came down this road, you would not like what you found. That story you told me... about a man who gets flowers for the moon, I had it backwards. I thought you were the moon and I was your wolverine. But you're the trickster, aren't you? I'm just the fool who got played. The worst part of it is, I should have known. But I ignored my instincts. I ignored what I really am. But that won't ever happen again. Colonel? Not now, Kayla. I've done everything you've asked. My sister. You said if I helped you, you'd let her go. Kayla, it's not as simple as that. Her mutation is unique. Quite beautiful. We just need a little more time to analyze it, that's all. You let him go? Victor, please. You can't let him go. You can't beat him, Victor. Then give me the Adamantium! Your tests came back. We had a deal! You would never survive the operation. I can take anything he can. No, you can't. You're my favorite soldier, Victor. Be patient. Your time will come. He's using us. How about this time... you die for real? Let me go. Your little mind games don't work on me. Victor! Feels good, doesn't it? All that rage. Do it. Logan! You're not an animal. Yes, you are. Do it. Finish it. Logan? My sister. They have my sister. Please. I didn't trick you into loving me. It was real for me, too. Please, I'm so sorry. They have my sister. Where is she? Activate Weapon XI! The bonding process isn't complete. Just do it! Now! Come on. Come on! Ok. Perfect. Kayla, get these kids out of here. Logan, Find another way out. Ok. Let's go. Wade, is that you? Guess Stryker finally figured out how to shut you up. Now... Wade? You don't have to do this. Alright, maybe you do. You're shitting me. Shoot on sight! I can help! Point me at them! Go. Go! Now! Did I get them? Yeah. Let's go. I can't go. Kayla, come on! I have to stay here. You take them. Go! Go! Go left. Left. What? We go left. You can't see. Trust me. Let's see you dance up here. Nobody kills you but me. Back to back! I got him! No, you don't. Stop! This can't be the way. This is the way. How do you know? I just know. Come on. Adamantium bullets. Let's see him heal with a few of these through his thick skull. You can't stop him, even with that. He'll heal. His brain may heal, but his memories won't grow back. This doesn't change anything between us, Victor. We're done. We can never be done, Jimmy. We're brothers, and brothers look out for each other. You miss me? Jesus. You know, when you said you were gonna kill everyone, I thought you may just have been exaggerating. Yeah. Do I look like a man who exaggerates? You're welcome. Logan? Logan. There's kids trying to get off the island. Split up. Go! I'm on it. Kayla! Kayla! Hey. I love you. Hey, I'm so cold. Listen to me. I'm gonna get you out of here. Understand? Just go easy. Nice and easy. That's it. That's it. Ok. I'm gonna get you help. Logan! I should make you pull the trigger. But that would make us no better than you. Throw the gun away. Turn around. Walk until your feet bleed. And then keep walking. It will be alright, Scott. My name is Charles Xavier I'm a mutant like you. I can hear your thoughts. Yes, and I can hear yours. You're safe now. Come. We have to go. Come on, let's go. The kids are safe. Damn. Who are you? What do you mean, who am I? I'm the guy who brought you here. Now, we got to go. Where the hell am I? Listen to me. I'm a friend. I'm a friend. Yeah? What's my name? What's my name? Your name is Logan. You need to trust me. We have to go. Follow me. Now! Do you know her? No. Hey, these boys aren't gonna like what you've done to this place. We really need to go. I'll find my own way. Good luck. By IESAIGNEUR Sync & corrections May 2020 Colonel Stryker?

{"title": "X-Deal (2011) - full transcript", "plot": "Photographer Billy and his girlfriend Sarah have just moved into a new apartment. They are no longer in love, but they content themselves with sex, often involving role play. Billy becomes enamored with their new neighbor Dana, who spends her days at home blogging and supplying drugs to a local dealer. The thing is, Dana's more attracted to Sarah. Billy lays out a deal: Dana can spend the night with Sarah, and in exchange, he gets to have sex with her. Billy manipulates the two ladies to get what he wants, but he fails to realize the risk of the arrangement.", "transcript": "foodval.com - stop by if you're interested in the nutritional composition of food   ---  \n        There are things money can't buy. Nonsense. One big figurative nonsense. Why would the world stop for an outdated ideology? Why? Is money the only way to acquire something? Why not trade? Why choose money if the prospect of the trade is so thrilling? For example, an epic merchandise for an epic commodity. Or a monumental necessity for an intense pleasure. Things that make the blood flow and arouse the mind. Like sex, drugs and rock n' roll. Drugs and rock n' roll can easily be traded on the spot \n \n \n \n    (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n \n or with a simple exchange by hand. There are only two rules. You can't return it, and you can't take it back. When it comes to sex, that's another story. But, there are things that might not be impossible but hard to compete with. However, like an old saying. Everything has a price. Even if something can’t be bought with money, it can be paid with something else worthwhile. Whatever it is, whoever it is. The house rules here are simple, sir. Hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil. In a simpler term, mind your own business. Don’t bother others' lives. \n \n \n \n    (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n \n That’s better. Are the tenants here okay? Yeah, they’re okay. They pay on time. That’s the usual problem of caretakers like me, when tenants fail to pay two to three months, we’re already planning on kicking them out. You'll find the wall that should be painted on it but there's no budget. Dana. Let’s go. Welcome, ma’am, sir. Yes. Here, darling. Spend it well, my dear girl. It’s really hard to get those. Because of the global warming? Because of the law of supply and demand. Good thing you’re not running out. As long as I have patrons in Baguio, expect that there’s grass. I give them narc, they give me corolessence of Mary Jane. Home-grown shit darling. Groceries, latex paint, resin, medium sized horse paper maché, and seven dildos? Groovy. I have a question. Go. Violet, green, red, light blue. Why are the dildos color-coded? They are the colors of the seven deadly sins. Hmm, okay. I love it when I spend quality time with my mother, for one, her brand of wisdom never fails to enlighten me. Well today, I learned about colors: violet is pride, green is for envy, wrath is red. Do what you need to do. Sloth, light blue. Greed is yellow. Gluttony, orange. Lust, the greatest of all sins is dark blue. I'll never look at the rainbow the same way again. Shit! Toto! To! I need you upstairs, come here fast. Okay. Your framing is perfect. You should’ve asked permission first. Sorry, you might get conscious. Candid shots are far better. Is that a toy? This? Lomo camera. Hmm, so you’re a Lomo-freak? Yeah, I’m into Lomography. By the way, I’m Billy. I’m Dana. Lomography? What’s the difference between that and Kodak or Canon? As far as I know, Kodakology or Canonigraphy doesn’t exist. It’s hard to explain. You should see the photos so you can easily understand it. So, do you have an on-going one-man exhibit there in your unit? I have. Am I invited? Of course. Now? Up to you. Hey, Dana, what’s the problem? My TV is broken, fix it. Okay. Where the fuck. Oh yeah. Hi, I’m Dana. I live beside your unit. Dana, come in. She’s Sarah, my girlfriend. Hi. She wants to see the photos. Okay, nice to meet you. I’m going. - See you. - Bye. She’s from theater production. She shows up in movies sometimes. Actress? Yup. Wow. Yeah. Let’s go, I’ll show you the photos. Okay. Let’s go. The emphasis of Lomography is to take casual and candid photographs to document everyday life. The more the approach is light-hearted, the more spontaneous it becomes. Anything goes, just click away. Actually, the blurring and the off compositions make the photograph. Look. Why use a saleslady as a subject? Nothing, just for fun. How about you, what keeps you busy? Blogging. Blogging? I get an average of five thousand hits per day. Ads are enough to make a living. Wow. So, how do you make a living with Lomo? That’s only a hobby. Non-profit shit. So, when can I see my picture? Ah, soon, soon. Maybe tomorrow or next week. Okay, I’m going back to my place. - Okay. - Thank you for the Lomo lecture. No problem, see you around. Okay. Oh, Dana, your TV is working already. The only thing that’s broken is its fuse. You’re so great, To, let me kiss you! Wait. Okay, okay. Here. Thanks. - By the way, thank you. - Thank you. Thank you. Miss, are you going out? Yes, sir. Are you a saleslady? Yes. Ladies’ wear? Ladies’ underwear. What is the brand of your panties? Do you want to see it, sir? Hi, are you going to work? Yeah. You too. No, I’m just going to accompany her to the car. Hi, may I borrow a blank CD? I’ll give it back tomorrow. - Is it okay? - Sure, come in. Here. Thanks. Anything else? Let’s have sex? Fucking idiot. How can you be so stupid? She’s wet, she just took a bath, and you just let her go! Idiot! Here, this belongs to a boxer who was beaten up. Dana! And this- Is there anything else you need? DVD-R? This is CD-R. Do you have any? None. To, next time bring some. Okay, all right. Okay, I’ll just use this. Okay. So that’s yours and this is mine. Hello, mom. I know, I know. Whatever you say, mom. You’re the boss. Yes, mom, I already saw the unit. It’s small but it’s okay. I'll call you back. Yes, later, later. All right, mom. Love you. Hmm, just the right shapes and colors. You didn't mess with them, did you? I still prefer all natural. Oh, yeah. So… left or right? They said, never feed two mouths with the same hand. Have you ever been in love? Of course, your question is cheesy, but yes, of course. With whom? With your father. Really? Would you come out of my vagina if I did not love your father? I thought I was just a product of a one-night-stand? Be proud, dear, you were a product of a long and meaningful night. Were you in love with him that time? Not yet. But the day after that, I fell for him. Your father gave me the best fuck a girl could ever have. It’s either I fall too easily or he’s too easy to be loved. Was he your first? Okay. Let’s say that I am a Virgin Mary or you are the Immaculate Conception. Still… Darling, sometimes we do things even without a deep thought. Just a simple desire, just a simple lust. Is it worth it? Lust that turned to love? Worth it. Let’s play. And who am I supposed to be right now? Tomboy? So, we're not gonna have sex? Because I'm a tomboy, right? Well, that's why it's so exciting, I can play rough with you. So, you're gonna hurt me first before you fuck me? If you agree. You fucking perv. Try me. Doesn't mean I'm playing with you, you can't just hurt me like that. I'm gonna have you locked up. Dammit! You’re too fussy! Mom? Mom! Mom? Mom! Do you have an extra candle? Yeah, come in. Give me a minute. What were you thinking? Did you think I was here to send you a signal? Is there anything else? Fuck you! I’m aiming for your girlfriend. Give that to me. Even your briefs are green. Sir, you were looking for me? Yes, dear. It’s about your grades, they’re failing, let’s make it better. Good morning! Pervert Lomographer! At least I'm honest about my feelings. So, you like Sarah. I can’t blame you, she’s one hot babe. Yeah, I like her. And so? You like her, I like you. Sounds like a fair trade. Fuck you! Seriously, sleep with me, you can have your night with Sarah. Trust me, it’s all worth it. You know what? I have a better idea, jump off the building and then say, “My briefs are green!” So, Dana is a lesbian. She admitted it. You got along with her pretty fast. So, how did it happen? \"Hi, I'm Dana, I'm a lesbian.\" \"And I'm Billy, I'm a closet maniac.\" You are her type. Dumbass, you jealous? No. But I have an idea… And what’s that? I told you that I want you to role play as a tomboy, right? I just thought that we can actually change the concept of our playtime, but this time, we’ll do it for real. I’ll have sex with Dana in exchange for you. She already agreed. Idiot! Crazy! So, you think I will agree? It's just a game. So, our relationship is all just a game, too? So, I’m your type? As a matter of fact, yes. My question is simple, I don’t need your poetry. Want to do it, or not? Yes. Well then, let me join your game. You guys talk about whoever goes first. I’ll get going, I have a rehearsal to attend. And you agreed? Don’t you want me to? When will I get my orders? Later. Okay, take care. Mom’s so annoying, she wants me to go back to the States, but I don’t want to. I prefer to stay here. Girls are more beautiful here. I’ll get it, bro. No, it’s okay. Dana. Wait for a while, bro. All right. Okay, game. Tomorrow at eight in the morning, in my unit. Me and Sarah will do it first, then after a week, it’s our turn. You agreed? Why, don’t you want me to? Sarah doesn’t even care. She said that we’ll do the scheduling. Really? By the way, why do we have to wait for a week? Is it wrong to let my vagina rest? Ah okay, one week. Got it. My mom is heading from the States and will be arriving tomorrow. You should go shopping. You can buy some new clothes. Oh. Now, tell me. You wanna play my game? What kind of theme do you want? A nursing student? A Saleslady? A college prostitute? Or my favorite, a blind virgin? Huh? Don’t you have any fantasy character? Just tell me, I’m willing do it. You know, I want you, the real you. Ah, bad actress who is into method acting. Okay, see you later. Here it is. Thank you. Thank you also! - Okay, Toto. Thank you. - Till next time. Do you know the consequence of this? Yeah. I mean, no. Are you scared? A bit. Yes. Well, Billy’s no serial killer, but he’s different. I’m sure he’ll make you pay for this. You know, you’re the most aggravated person here. Like what I asked you in the elevator, why did you agree? At first, I was shocked. But then, I realized that between me and Billy, he’s been honest about what he really feels. How can you say that? Well, I guess, when there’s no love in the relationship, there’s something else that you can hang on to. Like what? A good fuck. Billy was just taking it a notch higher. Oh, okay. And now, it’s his turn. Whatever happens, your end of the deal is to be his sex partner for one night. Nothing more, you don't need to satisfy him. Are you jealous? Nope. The truth is, I want you to enjoy. Let him do all the work. What if I didn’t like it? Then follow the tip for soon-to-be rape victims. What is it? Play dead, until the predator loses its appetite. In many ways, we take part in a trade. We do it while we taunt fate and mess with it. Sometimes, we end up short changed, bruised, and a wreck. People say we trade our souls to the devil whenever we give in to our sinful desires. We wallow in its carnal bliss, we laugh, we moan, we scream, we bleed. Sooner or later, we'll just have to deal with the consequence. I say it's a fair trade. Who’s your source? Huh? Shit. - Hello? - Fuck you all! Hi. Hi, hon, yup. Someone’s watching TV. Here, with my friends. Yeah. Is it loud? I’m sorry, I’ll drop by there after this, I’m just doing something. Yes? Oh, yes. Oh, yes. So, you’re home? Oh, no? I’ll just bring something for you, don’t worry. Sure. Love you, love you. Okay, I’m just doing something. - Love you. Bye. - You really don’t want to talk, huh? Who’s your source? Who’s your source? - What the heck? - What do you want? Fingers? Thank you. You’re actually really fussy. I’m kind. I changed the color for you. Faster! What are you doing? Idiot! Let me go! It hurts! Let me go! You’re a rapist, idiot! - No! I'm not a rapist. - He raped me! - We had a deal! - How dare you? You’re a rapist! No, I'm not, I'm not a rapist! You’re an animal! How dare you? We had a deal! - Bring him out! - Let me go! I’m not a rapist! - I didn’t do anything wrong! We had a deal! - Don’t believe him! He’s a liar! Sarah, tell them I'm not a rapist. Tell them we had a deal. Sarah! Sarah! Tell them. Sarah! Dana! I’m innocent, let me go! Sarah! - What the fuck? - Don’t let me go to jail for this! Guys, those bitches are lying. - You were caught in the act! - Sarah! Sarah! Hello, chief, the raid is negative. There’s no evidence here. Yes, chief. Enough, it’s over. Don’t worry, everything’s gonna be okay. I’ll be pulling the group out. All right. Everybody go back to your units. - Sir. Yes, sir. - Make sure that everything’s clear. We’ll be pulling out. Enough. Sir, at the police right now. Let’s go.", "url": "https://subslikescript.com/movie/X-Deal-2049597"},

You see, I have a school that is for young people who are like you. Special. \"Special\"'s just a nice word for... Weird? Or crazy? Yup. Yup, sometimes, it is. But sometimes, it-it can be a word used to describe people who are significant, amazing, or... just... just really cool. You've got gifts, Jean. D'you know what? Take this-this pen, right? It's something that... well, actually, just take it. It's a gift. Now, you could choose to draw a really good picture with that. Or... you could use it to poke someone's eyes out. But either way, it's- it's still just a pen. It's just a gift. And what you choose to do with your gift, well, that's entirely up to you. But if you want to use it to do good stuff, well, I can help.

Uh, ma'am, I got something on Sat six Houston, we have a problem. Space Shuttle Endeavor has encountered problems on its mission. I know what you're thinking. That's my trick. The answer is no. The jet can't get that high. Even with your new booster rockets, and all your modifications? They're built for acceleration, not elevation, okay? Not this. No. The system experienced massive failure. They've lost thrust vector control. Trajectory settings are irregular. Likely from the constant engine burn. Oxygen generation is down. Yes? Yes, this is he. Charles? Mr. President. Are you seeing this on TV? Yes, I'm watching now. Hank. Yeah. It's a simple extraction. We to into space. We get the astronauts. We bring them home. Any questions? Yeah. Like a thousand. We don't have time for a thousand. So we're going to space? Yes, Kurt, we are going into space. Doing space missions now. Cool. Will the X-Jet even get that high? Well, technically, the... It'll get us there. Let's go! Are you okay with this? I forget sometimes you can read minds. I didn't need to read your mind. It's written all over your face. You tell me it's good... it's good. If anything goes wrong, I'll turn this around in a heartbeat. I know you will. A second ship has been spotted in the sky. We have been told the President has called in the aid of the X-Men. Ladies and gentlemen of NASA, this is voice of Charles Xavier. Could someone please apprise me of the situation? We were picking up solar flares. We believe the heat shorted out their electricity. The lost control, communication, orientation, pretty much everything. Not to worry, Mission Control. Help is on the way. I think this is not as much fun as I thought it would be. That's... a solar flare? No, I've never seen a reading like this. The orientation thruster's misfiring. That cabin won't hold for long. Kurt, can you get in there? It's spinning too fast. I can't see inside the window. Scott, I need you to blast that thruster. Slow down the spin. Kurt, take Peter. Go. Storm, seal those cracks. Be right back. Oh, shit. Strap in, we're headed home. Wait, our Commander. He's not here. He was in the airlock working on the thruster. The heat signature's rising fast. I can't hold it any longer. We gotta get outta here. I said strap in! No. Raven, no. We're not leaving anyone behind. I am not putting this team in more danger. What about their team? Jean can hold that shuttle together. Can't you, Jean? You know you can do anything you set your mind to. I can hold the ship together but not from here. I need to get inside. The heat's spiking. We got less than a minute till those flares hit. She said she can do it. 30 seconds. Count it down. Go. Got 20 seconds. Ten... nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Where's Jean? Kurt, where is she? Where is she?! I'm sorry! Brace for impact! Is every... Is everybody okay? Yeah, we're okay. So let's go home. Yeah! X-Men! X-Men! X-Men! Yeah! X-Men! That's enough, boys and girls. Listen up. The X-Men have today done an incredibly brave thing. They've once again proved to humanity exactly why they need us. People like yourselves. The President sends his regards as well as his heartfelt gratitude. And as for myself, I've never been prouder. Enjoy yourselves. You certainly deserve it. In fact, you all do. No more class, the end of the day. Jean. You gave us quite a scare up there. How are you feeling? A-Actually, I... I feel fine. Hank? - Yeah? - Will you take a look at Jean? Standard medical for anyone injured in the field. You know, the President was almost sending his condolences. She should be dead. Thankfully, she's not. I basically did everything. I mean, Jean did a little, like, towards the end. But it was mostly all me. You put us in danger, Charles. You put those kids in danger. They're not kids anymore, Raven. And I care about their safety just as much as you do. Are you sure about that? 'Cause we're taking bigger and bigger risks. And for what? Please, tell me it's not your ego. Being on the cover of magazines, getting a medal from the President. You like it, don't you? As opposed to being hunted and despised. Well, you know, actually, I do. It's all just a means to an end, Raven. What end is that? Keeping us safe. You should understand better than anyone that we're only ever one bad day away from them starting to see us as the enemy again. So what, we wear matching costumes and smile at pictures - to make everyone feel safe? - That's a small price to pay for keeping the peace. By risking our people to save theirs? Yes! Yes. It's funny... I can't actually remember the last time you were the one risking something. And by the way, the women are always saving the men around here. You might wanna think about changing the name to X-Women. The heartbeat's strong, pulse is good. Brain activity's normal. The genetic reading, I'm gonna take another look at. What can't be right? Did you just read my mind without permission? Sorry, I didn't mean to, but... What can't be right? Whatever happened up there made you stronger. You know, I've never seen a power reading like this, you're... You're literally... I mean, you're off the charts. So, what does that mean? It means, um... Well, I have to build a better machine. But... h-how do you feel? I feel... good. Good. Well, as far as I can tell, you're good to go. - You can head upstairs. - All right. Thanks, Hank. Hank said that? \"Off the charts\"? - He did. - The big, blue, furry guy? The doctor? That Hank? That's the one. Why? Are you a little intimidated, baby? Constantly. Are you- Are you sure you're okay? I'm better than okay. God, I feel great! I do. I... I don't know, I feel like everything is... just... turned up. Yeah. No, it's just... It's what? I thought I lost you today. I know. But I came back to you. I'll always come back to you. Is that Luna? Probably just squirrels. Mmmm. I'm just gonna check on her. Be right back. Just stay. Tell her to shut up. Luna! Luna! Luna! Sshhh. Honey! Shh-shh-shh... What is it? What is it, honey? Oh, my God. Margaret? One more? After I finish this one. Two more? Yeah. - Hey. - Rocks? Thanks. How's she doing? She's, uh... Thirsty. Yeah, I see that. She seem okay to you? For someone who's just been hit with solar flares? I'd say she's doing pretty good. Thanks. You know, it wasn't so long ago we were throwing parties like this. Now we're the only ones left. Yeah. Last of the first class. I've been thinking. Maybe it's time for us to... move on. What do you... move on where? I don't know. It's just Charles... Whatever's going on between you two, it'll blow over. No, it won't. I love him, but he's different. Everything is... it's different now. Yeah. Well, we change the world so we could live in it. Yeah, but maybe that's what we should go do. This is our life, this is what we wanted. - Not like this. - Raven... It's not our life, Hank. It's his. What do you think the \"X\" in X-Men stands for? Charles and his X-Men are where we turn when facing our worst fears. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you. All I've really done is create a world in which children can find peace and pride in being different. Now, I know that some of you choose to call us \"superheroes\". I must confess, I don't really know what that word means but it is a damn sight better than what you used to call us. Come, dance with me. - You wanna dance? - Come on, Scott. Did... Did you hear what the kids are calling you? - Do I wanna know? - Yeah. Phoenix. It's cool, right? You know? Bird that rises from the dead. Uh... You okay? Maybe you should take a break. Jean? Stay away from me. Stop, stop, stop, stop. It's Jean. Stop, stop, stop, stop. Stop! Hi. Thank you. I'm terribly sorry everyone, but I'm going to have to leave. Thank you very, very much. What is it? What do you see? Nothing. Her mutation has grown too powerful. For the first time, I can't penetrate her mind. So that's what we're doing down here? I built Cerebro to amplify my power. I think that's the only way I'm going to get inside her head now. Hank, can you turn it up please? A little more. Thank you. There she is. Is it supposed to look like this? The mind of a psychic is a fragile thing. It takes only the slightest tap to take it in the wrong direction. I had to make adjustments to her mind when she was young. What kind of adjustments? Scaffolding... walls around... to keep out all the trauma. What did you do to her, Charles? I saved her. I think that whatever happened in space did something to her. In the process, those walls that I erected are being torn down. Quiet! What is that? I know. It is what I was trying to save her from. Table for one? The usual. What is that voice? Charles? Charles? She's waking up. Jean? Jean, don't be afraid. It's only me. I want you to remain calm. And I'd like you to focus on my voice. Get out of my head. Just stay... calm. Jean... She's fighting me, Hank. Turn it up. I hurt my father. He's alive. You're just feeling things you shouldn't. Your mind, it needs rest. You... You're lying to me. I can sense it. Turn it up. It's too much already. Don't do it, Hank. - Hank! - No, I won't do it. For God's sake, Charles! Get out of my head! Charles! - Charles! - Charles! Jean! Are you... Are you okay? What happened? We were outside and then... You had an accident. You blacked out. Did I... Did I do... do that? It's fine. No, it's not fine. It was an accident. I don't know what's happening to me. I can't control it. I can't stay here, Scott. I really... I need to go. What are you talking about? - Where are you going? - I need to see... I need to see my father. Your father? Your father's... He's a-He's alive, I can hear him. He-He died in the crash, remember? I'm sorry, Scott, I need to go. Hang on, hang on, hang on. Slow down. - Scott, please let me go, please! - Just slow down, please. I can't control it. When it comes, I can't stop it. Okay? I could hurt you again. I'll take that chance. I know. I know. But I won't. - Is he gonna be all right? - I'm gonna be fine. - He's not fine. - I'm going to be fine. What did you see? She's all... desire. All rage, all pain. And it's all coming out at once. Something's happening to her, Raven. She's... changing. Into what? I don't know. Jean's gone. She left. - Gone where? - I don't know. Charles, you can track her with your mind. Not anymore. She's grown too powerful, even for me. She said she was going to see her father. That doesn't make any sense, right? Prepare the jet. We're going to bring her home. Leave? Charles, you're in no condition. Stop... she's going to find... She's going to find nothing good there. Is this all that remains of our once great D'Bari empire? Good evening, Vuk. Good evening. Did you learn their language? With ease. What have you learned? The power is being contained inside one of them. This primitive species? She's stronger. A mutant. She has no idea what's happening to her. I could use that. If we can control that power, we can resurrect our race. Begin again. Here. Where is she? Can I help you? Dad? Jean. How do you know where we're going, Charles? If you can't track here, how do you know where she is? You know how. Jesus Christ. What did you do? I protected her. From the truth? There's another word for that. He told me you were dead. I never thought I'd be back here. It's the same. All of it. Can I get you something... to drink, or-or eat? Uh, no... I'm good. I'm... I'm really good. It's so good to see you. Um, I'll-I'll get you some water, okay? Quiet. Jean? All these photos, none of me. You never looked for me. Jean. Why didn't you look for me? Maybe we should sit down. No, I won't-I don't want to sit down. Why didn't you come looking for me? And don't try to lie, I can read your mind. I can't care for her. I don't even know what she is. I do. Then you'll take her? You didn't even say goodbye. I didn't get a chance to say goodbye to your mother. I was eight years old. How could you do that to me? You want to come in? Come all the way in. Don't forget what you did. It's not me. Quiet! No. I'm sorry, Jean. But my whole world died that day. And... you went with it. Jean, don't. Please. Stop that. Stop it. It's not me. It's them. You shouldn't have come here. Why is that? We've only come to bring you home, Jean. I don't have a home. You made sure of that. Look, your father couldn't handle you and we took you in. You told me my father was dead. And you used me for my powers. No, that's just not true. That's not what happened. Jean, we can help you. I can help you but you have to listen to me. No. No, I don't. Scott. You lied to me, Scott. About everything. We'll figure everything out together. Just come back to me. Remember? You said you'd always come back to me. Come back to me. Jean. Stay away from me. Stay away from me. Stay away from me! - Stop her, quickly! - Charles, wait, wait! Jean, please! Jean, stop! - I got the shot, I'm taking it. - No, you're not. I'm sorry, Hank. I want Raven to have a chance. I told you to stay away. That's never gonna happen. Please. Stop. Not until I know you're gonna be okay. Something's... happening to me. So, come home. Let me take care of you. No, you can't. You can't, you don't... You don't... know what it's like. Then tell me. 'Cause when it comes... people get hurt. I'm not afraid of you, Jean. Look at me. Focus on my voice. We're going to get through this together. I'm not giving up on you, Jean. This is what family does. We take care of each other. You're my family, Jean. Can't... catch my breath. I love you. What? Raven, please. Raven, don't leave me. No. No. We are all at war. At war with ourselves. Raven had been waging that war for most of her life. I hope now, she's found peace. Raven died doing what she did best. Helping a friend. A friend in need. She is not gone. She lives on through me. Through us. And through the spirit of the X-Men. Is it true? Jean killed her? She didn't know what she was doing. Jean lost control. But she's-she's still Jean. Sh-She's still our friend. We can still help her. We can find her. We bring her home. That's-That's what we're gonna do, okay? It wasn't an accident, Scott. She killed Raven. Maybe you can't admit that to yourself, or to them. But it's the truth. That was not Jean. Not the Jean I know. Sometimes, you want to believe people are something that they are not. And then by the time you realize who they are, it's too late. D'you know, this is where I first met Raven. She was just this little girl. And she broke in, looking for food. I said she could stay and that she'd never have to go hungry again. And then I think I promised her a better life. And then you took it from her. - I beg your pardon? - You heard me. - Hank. - This is your fault, Charles. It's your fault that she's dead. Come on, that's not fair. Fair? Oh, now, talk about fair. You messed with the mind of an eight-year-old girl. You pushed out all that pain and anger. Where do you think it's gonna go? I did that to help her. What I do, I do to help her. Oh, please, come on, please! You still can't see what you did wrong? This is... No, you need to face this, Charles! You need to face it! Come on, admit it to me right now! Come on! Admit it! Charles, just admit you were wrong, please. You still can't. I really hope you feel better, Hank. I hope that raving on me five minutes after I put my foster sister in the grave is making you feel a damn... This isn't about me. You know what, I know what I did wrong, okay Charles?! She was gonna leave. Raven was gonna leave. And I talked her out of it! She saw what the rest of us didn't. And what was that? This whole time, we've been trying to protect these kids from the world, when really, we should've been protecting them from you. I don't know what's happening to me. Why? Why did I do that? No civilians past this... FBI. Give us the room. And who are you supposed to be? We're the ones who are going to help you, Mr. Grey. I didn't know she was gonna come back. I'm sorry for all this. It's okay. We just want to get an accurate picture of who Jean is. Tell us about when you gave her to the mutant. Um... Maybe, uh... It might be better if I talked to a lawyer. I'm so sorry, Mr. Grey. But I need to know everything about her now. This truly is an unfortunate development. Why-Why is that? Because it's so much easier to understand your language when you're not screaming. Who are you? What are you doing here? Answer the question. Leave her. Why are you here? Are you hurt? No. You have to forgive them. They're not accustomed to uninvited guests. Please. Why don't you start at the beginning? Whose blood is that? What? On your shirt. Whose blood is it? Look, I'm not Charles. I can't read your mind. You hurt people. - It's been a while. - But you did. Yes. What did you come here to ask me? How did you stop? I've lived with vengeance my whole life. Ever since I was a child, I... lost everyone I ever loved. So... I hurt people. Yes. Killed people. Killed whatever I thought would make the pain go away. It didn't. No matter how many souls I sent under. So I stopped. I don't know how to stop. I don't know what's happening to me. When I lose control... things happen, bad things. To people I love. Whose blood is that? Isn't that why you came here? What do you think I can do for you? - I don't know! - Yes, you do. - Whose blood is that? - I don't wanna talk about it. - Did you hurt someone? - Please! Answer the question, Jean. Stop, Erik, you're making me angry. Good! I want you to be angry. - Show me what happens, Jean. - I don't wanna hurt you! What happens when you're angry? Show me. - Show me... - Stop! We've got military. Inbound. Stay here. Two birds. U.S. Tell everyone to stay calm, but ready. Right. That's far enough. We have a legal right to be here. This land was given to us by the U.S. government. We have no intention of taking it back. We're not here for you. We're looking for one of the X-Men. Jean Grey. Haven't seen her in a long time. Then you won't mind if we look around. I don't have a home. You made sure of that. Would you mind if I came to your home, unannounced and uninvited? Look, I know who you are. - I don't want a fight. - No, you don't. Then step aside. We have the same rights as you and your family. And like I said, we're not here for you. We're here for a girl who gave up those rights when she attacked a squad of police officers. They have families, too. Guess you didn't hear about that. We don't get the news out here, Captain. Stop that. I said, stop that right now! It's not me. It's me. Jean? Jean! Get down! Get in the chopper and go! I can't hold it! Fall back! Fall back! Move, move, move! That's okay, move it! Come on! Come on! Go! Leave this place! I need your help. I thought you protected mutants here? I am protecting them. From you. You need to leave. Go! We're coming late tonight that Congress is considering temporary mutant internment facilities for those whose powers have been deemed a clear and present danger to human citizens. This, coming on the heels of the Jean Grey incidents, which, after destroying two communities, and attacking police and military personnel... This is Charles Xavier, I need to talk to the President. Mr. Xavier, this phone will no longer be operational. I... have to tell him not to do this. There's no need to throw away everything that we've accomplished. You have to give us a chance... If you break something... anything, I can fix it. Not anything. An international search is underway for Grey. Authorities are urging citizens to keep their distance Any sighting should be reported to the police immediately. Government officials have... This man was elect... Is that all ya got? Give me another. Hello, Jean. You can't control my mind like theirs. I'm not like them. Same, please. How did you find me? Let's just say, I have friends in high places. Who are you? The better question is, who are you? Are you a scared little girl who answers to a man in a chair? Or are you the most powerful creature on the planet? I don't know who I am. Yes, you do. You're the girl who everyone abandons. Maybe they had good reason. Because of what's inside you? You're afraid of it because it makes you bad. Evil. All the words you've been taught to keep you in line. Words created a very long time ago by men with very little minds. They can't begin to comprehend what you are. Even your X-Men. You can? Charles. Charles. Charles. Hey, Hank's not in class. Uh, what? Hank's not in class. Did you check his quarters? Yeah, he's not there, either. Where are the rest of them? No, I'm alone. What, no Charles? If you're looking for Jean, she's gone. No, I know that. Well, why are you here, Hank? You have eyes and ears around the world to help you find mutants for this place. I want you to help me find Jean. I have no reason to find her. Not for me. Do it for Raven. She send you? You don't know? Know what, Hank? Raven's dead. Jean killed her. I need you to help me find Jean. If I find her, I'll kill her. I know. They know who I am? Yes. And they're not afraid of me? The only person here afraid of your power... is you. This is what you wanted to show me? No. This is what I want to show you. What entered you in space was not a solar flare. And it was not an accident. It was drawn... to you. What was it? A pure and unimaginably powerful cosmic force. We saw it enter you in space. We were there, Jean. Following that force. Why? Because it's the spark that gave life to the universe. And the flame that consumed my world. What remains of my people searched the stars for that power to control it. But it destroyed everything it ever came into contact with. Until you. Why me? Because you're stronger than you know. Because you're special, Jean. With my help, you could control what's inside you. Harness that power to create whole new worlds. Turn dust into water. Water into life. It's your destiny, Jean. To become something greater. To evolve into the greatest force in the galaxy. I told you they could never understand you. And what they don't understand, they fear. And what they fear... They seek to destroy. Did Raven suffer? Not for long. I know we've had our... differences in the past, but... We both love Raven. Yes. Yes, we did. There's been a sighting of the girl. Where? New York. We'll have eyes on the ground when we get there. It's time. We know where Jean is. I thought you said you couldn't track her. It wasn't me who found her. It was Erik. Hank's with him. They're on their way to her. And they're gonna kill her. And anyone who stands in their way. Kurt, I'd like you to take Scott and I there, but that's all. I want you to leave us there, then come home. And me? I'm not talking to you now as X-Men. Scott and I will go and fight for Jean without you. End of discussion. Storm, I have lost so many of the people I love. I'm not going to ask you to go. Oh, yeah. We need you. I need you. I've got your back. - Look. - End of discussion. Kurt, close your eyes. I'll show you our destination. Where are they? She's in there. Hello, old friend. Save the \"old friend\" shit, Charles. And stay out of my way. I'm sorry for what she did. But I can't let you go in there. You're always sorry, Charles. And there's always a speech. But nobody cares anymore. We do this here, now, they'll see us as monsters. Violent freaks fighting on the streets of New York. What did I tell you? Damn it, man, your homeland will be gone! Everything you care about. Save it. If you touch her, I will freaking kill you. Don't do this, Erik. Killing Jean will not bring Raven back. The girl dies. Kurt, I need you! Kurt, get me inside. You're not the only one who can control minds. Kurt! They're coming to kill you. You're not gonna let them. You're gonna fight back. Feel the power inside you. That power is you. Hold them! I know whose blood that was. You cast me out. Now you come here to kill me? That's right. And you couldn't even do that. Let me show you how. Scott, a little help. Kurt! Kurt, Kurt! You all right? No! Come here! Get me in that house, now! You've come to kill me, too? Never. Jean, never! I failed you, I know that, but... this isn't you. Jean, please! You have no idea who I am. I've raised you since you were a little girl, I think I do. She's not your little girl anymore. What are you? Jean, please, try and remember what I told you. You can control it. You can do anything you set your mind to. So, show me. Walk to me. You know I can't. No... Please, Jean. Please! I can't see your mind anymore. Do you see mine? Look. Jean, look. What you choose to do with your gift, well, that's entirely up to you. This could be your new home. We could be your new family. No! Because you are not broken. Will you take her? Yes. I can help her in ways that you can't. She can't be helped. She's a lost cause. No, she's not. As long as there's someone who cares for her who believes, then there's still hope. There's still hope. I knew... I knew you were still in there. He just showed you your past. Follow me into your future. No. Set weapons to neutralize. I never asked for this. Any of it. I traveled the stars for a gift that you don't want? Then take it. Please. Free me. I'll try. Stop it, you're going to kill her! Your lives mean nothing. Your world will be ours. You'll kill us all. Yes. Jean, you have to let go. Jean, let go! Let go, Jean, let go! Let go! There's one! Get him! Jean! Jean. Jean? Jean, Jean? - Charles, what's wrong? - I don't know. I can't read her mind. Come on, out! Take him out! Come on, out, out! Get it, come on. Go, move, move, move! She's alive. Scott, you have to get her out of here. We're clear! Last one. Okay, clear, clear. Get back, let's go! My kid used to be a fan. Raven had the right of it. Jean was never the villain. I was. I should never have lied to her. I was wrong. But... this power inside of her, I never put that there. I would never do anything intentionally to hurt her. That isn't me. And this... is not Jean. We can still save her. She's still Jean inside. We're 10 mile out from Mutant Containment Center. Prepare for prisoner transfer. What exactly is controlling her? I don't know. But this woman, this... thing has had a taste of that power and she'll be coming back for more. She'll be coming back for Jean. Good. Let her. She'll kill her to get it. And I promise you, the killing will not end there. That's not what Raven would've wanted. You know that. You both do. Cooper, are you seeing this? Alpha One, you have multiple hostiles on board. They're heading towards the back. - Open four to five. - Copy that. All right, you two, come with me. The rest of you, stay here, guard the prisoners! Don't be fools! You need our help. Lock it down, now! Goddamn muties come to spring ya. They're not mutants. Free us. You're going to need our help. We're the only chance you have. Keep your mouth shut. Mayday mayday may... What's the status on those mutants? We're falling back now. They're not... - What? - They're... - They're not what? - They're not mu... They're here for Jean. Get ready to open fire. Y-Y-Your kid was right about us. We could help you! Please! There's more! We only want the girl. Step aside. No! What are you doing? What Raven would have. Scott, get me to Jean! Selene! Hank! Help Storm! No, no, no. No, no. No, no, no, no, please. Don't die! Scott, guard the entrance. Jean, wake up! Jean, wake up, you have to wake up. Hank! I have no desire to fight you. I get that a lot. You wanted her dead. I had a change of heart. I was trying to protect you. I was trying to keep the pain away. But... You just buried it. Jean. Where...? Are we inside my mind? It's more peaceful than mine. I'm so sorry for what I did to you. I know. All I ever wanted was to protect you and give you what you deserve. What every child deserves. A family. Yes. I know you did what you did out of love. I forgive you. I know what I need to do now. What is that? Protect my family. Jean, wait. You want this power? You're gonna get it. Jean! You can't control it. If you kill me, you'll kill... them all. Your emotions make you weak. Jean! No. Jean! You're wrong. My emotions make me strong. She's gone. She... She is free. I know who I am now. I am not simply what others want me to be. I am not destined to a fate I can't control. I evolved beyond this world. This is not the end of me. Or the X-Men. It's a new beginning. Hey! Slow down. Safety first. Is that all, monsieur? Oui, merci. How's your time treating you? What are you doing here, Erik? Came to see an old friend. Fancy a game? Not today, thank you. A long time ago, you saved my life. And you offered me a home. I'd like to do the same for you. Just one game. For old times' sake. I'll go easy on you. No, you won't. subs by enwansix", "url": "https://subslikescript.com/movie/X-Men_Dark_Phoenix-6565702"},

And brothers protect each other. You have to be hard now, hard so nothing can ever touch us. - I want to go home. - We can't. We stick together, no matter what, and take care of anyone who gets in our way. Can you do that, little brother? - I'm going down to the river. - They're coming. - Head over the hill. Hurry! - Can you run? - Keep on running and don't look back. - Okay. Back to back! That's enough! Enough! No! No! Stand down, soldier! Victor! Stand down! Stand down! Stand down! No! Ready, aim... Wake me when it's over. ...fire! Freaks! You're animals! Freaks! My name is Major William Stryker. You've been charged with killing a senior officer. Is that correct? Apparently, we have some issues with authority... - Just keep a lid on it. ...sir. The warden tells me that your sentence was carried out by a firing squad at 1000 hours. - How'd that go? - It tickled. You boys tired of running? Tired of denying your true nature? - What do you care? - Oh, I care. I care because I know how special you are. How valuable. Look, you can stay here locked up like freaks of nature, or you can join me. I'm putting together a special team with special privileges. Now, tell me, how would you like to really serve your country? You know, I love this weapon more than any other thing in the whole wide world. - Do you wanna know why? - No. It's memorable. Sure, it's a little bulky, tough to get on a plane. You whip out a couple of swords at your ex-girlfriend's wedding, they will never, ever forget it. That's funny, Wade. I think you confuse me with someone who gives a shit. Right, it's probably not as intimidating as having a gun or bone claws or the fingernails of a bag lady. - Manicure? - Victor. Easy. Fred got a new tattoo. I'm concerned. Oh, Jesus, Fred, you just met her last night. - I love her. - You love her after one night? She's a gymnast. Bradley, take her down. Oh, God. - Are you gonna puke? - Lf we were meant to fly, - we'd grow wings. - Don't worry, Nancy. - More people die driving than flying. - How about from impaling? Hey, be nice, or be your approximation of nice. - Would you like a bucket? - No. Gentlemen, wheels down in Lagos in five. - Why are we here? - All in good time. Zero? - Intruder! Perimeter breach! - Man the weapon! Intruder, stop! Put your hands behind your head! Having fun yet? - Fred? - The tank? - The tank. - Yeah, I got that. Great. Stuck in an elevator with five guys on a high-protein diet. - Wade. - Dreams really do come true. Just shut it! - You're up next. - Thank you, sir. You look really nice today. It's the green. It brings out the seriousness in your eyes. - Oh, my God. Do you ever shut up, pal? - No. Not when I'm awake. Bradley? Top floor, please. Cover the elevator! The elevator! Time to go to work. Okay. People are dead. If you didn't have that mouth on you, Wade, you'd be the perfect soldier. I wouldn't do that if I was you, brother. - Take the diamonds. They're yours. - I don't want your diamonds. I want this. But that is nothing. A souvenir. Where did you find it? I want the source. A small village, far inland, three days from here. Tell him this rock is more valuable to me than his life. Ask him where he found it. Okay. He says it came from the sky. He's telling the truth. You don't know the language, Logan. - It's a meteor fragment. - I know what it is. I'm asking him where he found it. Sir, base wants to know our location. - Shut them down. - Yes. Tell him everyone here will die unless he tells me where he found the rock. - He says that it's sacred. - Okay, fine. Victor. Victor! Don't even think about it. We didn't sign up for this. Put him down! What are you doing? We finally got a good thing going here. Don't you screw this up. Enough. That's enough. We've done enough. Who do you think you are? This is what we do. Maybe you'd rather be rotting in a hole somewhere till they figure out a way to do it to us. Is that it? Huh? I'm done. You coming? Jimmy! We can't just let you walk away. Jimmy! Jimmy! Why are you up so early? Come here. See you, baby. Hey. Oh, that's nice. Yes. Take your time. You're wrapped, man. Okay, I'm totally gonna get this. Nope. Come on. Oh, wow! Let's go on the Ferris wheel. - How does he do it? - Come on. ...amazing lady in a box! Swing the hammer, ring the bell! Hey, what do you do? If you turn off the light, you win a prize. - Three tries for a buck. - Come on, I wanna do it. There you go. Okay? No, that's obvious. That's two. Well, that's a stupid trick. It's not a trick, man. Come on. Freak. Bye. Show's over! I said show's over! The show's never over for us, Bradley. - Victor. - Aren't you gonna invite me in? Yeah. Come on in. You know, I've never said anything to anyone about what happened. I'm living a totally different life now, Victor. No need to bring up the past. You know, I always thought it would be Wade to come knocking at my door. Well... Well, Wade's gone. I'm not afraid of you, Victor. I'm not afraid of dying. How do you know? You've never tried it before. Was it the wars? Which one? All of them. - Tell me. - Hey. It's just a scratch. Looks like we're gonna need new sheets again, baby. Yeah. Who the hell is this? Smells like government. My God. Haven't aged a day! Clean living. - You remember Agent Zero? - Still shooting first, asking questions later? - You still chewing on cheap cigars? - Boys, please. - I have a job for you. - I already have a job. Lumberjack? 18 grand a year? 18.5. Plus I haven't had to kill anyone in a while. - Starting to miss it? - Right about now I am. - Yeah? - Zero, back to the car. Attaboy. You know, I'm not proud about the way things ended between us. Conversation's over. /Playing Little House on the Prairie /with a schoolteacher, I mean, that just isn't you, Logan. And you would know, huh? - I would. - What do you want, Stryker? Bradley was killed three days ago. Wade before that. I believe that someone is hunting down our old team. - Anyone else? - As far as I know, Victor is safe. But whoever it is has names, addresses. I can take care of myself. This is not about you, Logan. Your country needs you. I'm Canadian. I know you, Logan! I know who you are! - Miss Kayla, Miss Kayla, look what I did. - What did you do? Bye, Miss Silverfox! Bye! What's wrong? Stryker came by today. Don't worry. I said no. Why is he bothering you after all these years? Because I'm the best there is at what I do, but what I do best isn't very nice. You're not an animal, Logan. What you have is a gift. A gift. You can return a gift. Come on, fellas. All right. Stay in the car. I'm just gonna ask nicely. You mind letting us go by? - You in some kind of a hurry there, pal? - Hey, hey, hey. Are you? Just move your truck so we can go by. We're trying to have a conversation there, all right? You start something, you'd better be ready to finish it. Listen... Hey, guys, take it easy! Calm down. - Your boyfriend's got a big mouth. - I know. Big temper, too. So please let us pass. - Thank you. - Come on, man, let's go. How'd you do that? Female powers of persuasion. It's a gift. Oh, I see. Do you have those powers over me? Well, you didn't stay in the car, did you? Why is the moon so lonely? Why? Because she used to have a lover. - You tell this to the kids? - No. His name was Kuekuatsheu and they lived in the Spirit World together. Oh, this is a true story? All right. And every night they would wander the skies together, but one of the other spirits was jealous. Trickster wanted the moon for himself, so he told Kuekuatsheu that the moon had asked for flowers. He told him to come to our world and pick her some wild roses, but Kuekuatsheu didn't know that once you leave the Spirit World, you can never go back. And every night he looks up in the sky and sees the moon and howls her name. But he can never touch her again. Wow. Koo-koo-ka-choo got screwed. \"Kuekuatsheu.\" It means \"the Wolverine\". What you doing, Logan? Kayla. Oh, God. Kayla! You're not from around here, are you? What gave me away? Victor! - You got insurance on this place? - Insurance? No. - Too bad. - Victor! Well, well, well. Look what the cat dragged in. Guys, whatever this is, take it outside. Why? Why? You don't call. You don't write. How else am I supposed to get your attention? I hate to say it, Jimmy, but, frankly, I'm a little disappointed. Stay down. Tell me something, Jimmy. Was she worth it? When are you gonna figure it out? We're not like them. I am nothing like you. Sure, you are. You just don't know it yet. - What do we got? - Bar fight. Multiple knife wounds. What is this, a joke? Guy's fine. - Where is he? - Hey, hey, don't... - I said, where is he? - I don't know who he is. I can help you. Six years I've been here. No one knew me, and then you show up, and the next day she's dead! I tried to warn you. Why didn't you tell me it was Victor? - I didn't know! - Bullshit! - Why? - I swear on my son's life, I didn't! Victor's appetites were becoming too public. I had to lock him up. He felt I betrayed him. Went AWOL. He said he was coming after all of us. You didn't come to warn me, you came to save your own ass. So what's your plan, Captain? You can't beat him, Logan, you know you can't! I'm gonna find him and kill him. I can give you the tools to defeat him. And we can still save the others. You mean save yourself, right? I promise you two things. You will suffer more pain than any other man can endure, but you will have your revenge. I come with you, I'm coming for blood. No law. No code of conduct. You point me in the right direction, you get the hell out of my way. When it starts, whatever the reason is that you're doing this, focus on that. Maybe it will help. Trust me, I've been through worse. No, you haven't. We're ready. We're gonna make you indestructible, but first we're gonna have to destroy you. You remember what we were looking for in Africa? - I remember. - Well, I found it. It helped us create a metal compound so strong that you will be able to withstand virtually anything. It's called Adamantium. I can't put Victor down myself, Logan. To kill him, you're gonna have to embrace the other side. Become the animal. Let's do this. I almost forgot. I want new ones. What do you want them to say? Wolverine. Generals, welcome. General Munson. Today we're gonna witness medical history. - Today we're gonna create Weapon X. - X? Roman numeral 10. We are about to begin bonding Adamantium to Weapon X's skeleton. Let's begin. /- We're brothers, Jimmy. - Logan! Body temperature, 108 and rising. Why is he thrashing like that? Why isn't he sedated? He feels pain just like the rest of us, but anesthesia won't work on him. - That's why he had to volunteer. - Heart rate, 190. 195. - Will he survive this? - I don't know. 200. Son. Heart rate well beyond maximum. - Blood pressure? - 260 over 180 and rising. He can make it. He can make it. Victor! /I love you. /You're not an animal. It means \"the Wolverine\". Well, I guess he can die. Come on, old friend. Come back. Heart rate rising. Adamantium reservoir is depleted. No rejection. Procedure completed. - We did it. - We did it. Yeah! Yes. Are we taking him to the island? The island? No. The bonding works. We'll use his DNA for the XI. Erase his memory. Erase his memory. I think he heard you. Lock down! Hunt him down. Take his head off. Travis. - I think there's a naked man in the barn. - Yep. Son? What in hell you doing? - It's cold. - Cold. - You got no clothes on. - Yeah. - You're not on the drugs, are you? - No. - No, just had a rough night. - Yeah, you could say that. Come on up to the house. Some of my son's old clothes will probably fit you. Here. Cover it up with that, huh? I don't want you giving the old lady a heart attack. - You all right in there? - Yeah, yeah, I'm fine! Supper's on the table. Yeah, I'll be there in a minute. I swear, I'm gonna pay for it. - Set it down over there. - Right. Come and sit down, son. I can't thank you both enough for everything. It wouldn't have been decent to leave you out there to freeze. - \"Decent.\" - What? Nothing. I'm just not really used to that word. That's a nice chopper you've got out there. - You know motorcycles? - Oh! Lord, here we go. My favorite's a '48 Panhead. Bought one new off the line. I think you're a little young for that, son. You must be exhausted. You get a good night's sleep. In the barn. Nothing you can break out there. /Why is the moon so lonely? /Why? /Because she used to have a lover. /He can never touch her again. You sleep okay? Yeah. You look like a man fixing to do a bad thing. You know what happens to men who go looking for blood? - What? - They find it. We all got a choice, son. - Yeah, well, mine got taken. - Bullshit. This was my son's jacket. Try it on. - Thank you. - Yep. You want to take my bike for a spin? Test the suspension? '64, huh? Man, you're heavy. Yeah, I put on a little weight recently. - Good morning! - Good morning. Oh. It fits you beautifully. I brought you some... Weapon X is in the barn. He's just murdered two civilians. Blow him to bits. Let's see if he can survive that. Come get me. Blow his brains all over the road! Damn it! Alpha one, do not lose him! Alpha two! Target coming to you! Pull up! Pull back! Pull back! /Zero? /Zero, come in. /Zero? /- Zero, is Logan dead? - I don't know. I'm down. /Zero, is he dead? Is Logan dead? /Zero, come in. /You tried to kill me. - Logan? - Where's Victor? Come back to base. I'll explain everything. We'll take Victor down together. Wrong answer. After I kill Victor, I'm coming for you. /Logan, listen to me. If you go down this road, you're not gonna like what you find. You wanted the animal, Colonel. You got it. Those were good people back there. Innocent people. It's funny how good, innocent people tend to die around you. Zero never stood a chance. The only thing that'll take him down is an Adamantium bullet. This facility's compromised. Prep transport. Colonel, this is turning into a disaster. - Don't worry. We'll stop him. - Really? You just spent half a billion dollars making him indestructible. - Sir? - Yes? The young mutant you've been looking for. We've found him. General, Logan isn't the only piece of this puzzle. I need to evacuate this facility. Please go back to Washington. We've got work to do. /Yo hablo, I talk. /Es hablas, you talk. /El habla... Somebody translate. Summers! Sit up and take off those glasses. I have a headache. Then you can wear them in detention after school while you write out this conjugation 100 times. - Somebody else? - He talks. /Thank you. He talks. El habla. - You sure it was Victor? - Yeah. Damn. I'm sorry, man. What the hell happened to him after I left? He got worse. He felt like you abandoned him. Hell, we all did. But Victor, he had to prove he was better than you. Hunting and killing everything he was pointed at. Quit a few months later myself. Couldn't take rounding them up. - Rounding who up? - Leave it alone. Rounding who up, John? Hey! Damn it, John! We hunted our own kind, Logan. There's a special place in hell for the things we did. Mutants? Why? Stryker said we'd be making a difference, protecting people from the bad ones. How are you gonna take Victor down, Logan? - Remember that stuff in Africa? - Yeah, I remember Africa. What about it? Damn. What'd they do to you, man? Don't ask. Listen, Zero said something about an island. Does that mean anything to you? Nope. But maybe Dukes knows. - Him and Zero were real tight. - Fred Dukes? Where is he? - He's here. - Well, let's go talk to him. Hold on. He don't get in till around 4:00. But I got to warn you, he developed a bit of an eating disorder. We all got our coping mechanisms. I'm trying to whup him back into shape. Whatever you do, don't mention his weight. Come on, Fred, if you wanna get in shape, you got to move, man. I told him he got to move. He's got to move! What? Fred Dukes? That looks like the creature that ate Fred Dukes. Hey, be nice, man. Hey, fat... Fred. I seem to remember that girl when she was about 85 pounds, huh? Oh, that's funny. You're still so funny, Logan. You know where Victor is? - No idea. - What's the island, slim? Don't let the door hit you on the way out, Logan. Listen, I ain't leaving here till you tell me where Victor is. So come on, bub, for old times' sake, huh? Did you just call me Blob? No, but... I told you not to mention his weight. Why'd you call him Blob? I didn't call him Blob. I said \"bub\". - God damn it. - Hey, hey, hey. Hey, Logan. I got an idea. - This is your idea of an idea? - I'm trying to help you out, Logan. Dukes don't like you that much and you know it. - Yeah, the feeling's mutual. - Well, use them gloves, man. Dance with him a little bit. Allow him to let his anger out on you. Figure if you do that, he'll probably tell you everything you want to know. Come on, man, look at him. Got a big old ass coming out the front of his shirt. Jesus. He's gonna have a coronary, for Christ's sake. Is there even a stretcher big enough to take this guy out of here? It ain't him I'm worried about getting out of here on a stretcher. - You're an asshole. - Come on, Logan. - Whup his ass! - You want it? Dance with him, Fred! Just like I taught you. You want to dance with me? - Come on, Fred! - Oh! Oh, that feels good. Hey! Guess what? See, he gonna talk now. - You got him right where you want him. - Whose side are you on, anyway? Come on! Come on, now, lamb chop! Damn! Now, where's Victor? Little dark for sunglasses, don't you think? - Please, don't! Please, don't! - Victor! Hey, hey! Where's Victor? Yeah. Victor's with Stryker on the island. They run it together. What? They what? Victor will be with Stryker? Yeah. You didn't know that? All that's left now is Logan. I trust you can handle that. - I did before, didn't I? - Oh, yes. You did that. Our deal. It still applies, right? Of course. Now bag him and tag him, Captain. What's the island? It's where Stryker takes them after Victor's caught them. Wait, hang on a minute. Takes who? Mutants. Rumor is that Stryker's doing experiments on them there. I mean, you never wondered what happened to them? I tried not to. They killed her so I'd let them put Adamantium in me. They killed her for a goddamn experiment. - Where is it? Where is it? - Logan, Stryker kept it real secret. But a prisoner escaped there once. - Who? - His name was Remy LeBeau. He was a street hustler from New Orleans. The guards at the prison called him Gambit because he kept taking all their money at poker. - That's all I know. - What's Stryker up to, Fred? What's the endgame? He's taking their powers. Trying to combine them somehow. That's all I know, Logan. That's all I know. If I have to come back here, I'm gonna take your head off. I'm coming with you, Logan. - There's no redemption where I'm going. - I ain't asking. There's our dude. That's cool. I'm gonna go cover the back in case he rabbits. - I'm not gonna fight with him. - Yeah, right. What? I get in fights with everybody? Don't dogs kill cats? Just go cover the back, will you? - Give me 500. - I'm in. Are you Remy LeBeau? - Do I owe you money? - No. Then Remy LeBeau I am. Large blind's 100. Small blind's 50. - May I deal you in? - What can I get for 17 bucks? $17? A cab ride home, perhaps? You my brother's new babysitter, John? I ain't Bradley, Victor. And your creepy black coat don't scare me. Really? Worked on Dukes. You shouldn't have done that, 'cause now I'm gonna kill you before Logan even gets a chance. So what brings you to our fair city, sir? Victor Creed. And who's that? The man I'm gonna kill. He works with a man named Stryker on an island. - Just need to know where it is. - And why would you think I know that? Well, 'cause I know who you are, Gambit. You're the guy who escaped and you're the guy who's gonna take me back there. You know, John, there's something I always wanted to tell you. You're predictable. I can feel your spine, Johnny Boy. That's funny. Never knew you had one. Those are mighty nice tags you have on there, sir. The men who took me wore tags just like them. Hey, now, bub, you listen to me. Damn it. That little... Two years I rotted in that hellhole and I ain't never going back. Shiny. Tell me something, Jimmy. Do you even know how to kill me? I'm gonna cut your goddamned head off. See if that works. You're getting slow, old man. You son of a bitch. You're gonna die for what you did to her. Victor! Well, that's a nice stick. Okay, shithead, here's the deal. See, you're gonna take me to this island, where I can kill Creed, Stryker and pretty much everyone you hate in this world. Do you understand? You're really gonna kill them? As long as you stay out of my way, yeah. Colonel? - General? - Is this Weapon XI? All their strengths and none of their weaknesses. You really hate them, don't you? No, I don't hate them. After 20 years of working with mutants, I just know what they can do. We can win this war before it starts and save countless lives in the process. Pre-emptive action is the only action here, General. The days of our country sitting on the sidelines are over. We need to take the fight to the enemy before they take the fight to us. - I admire your passion, I do. - Thank you. But this is as far as it goes. - Weapon X was a hiccup. - We know about your son, Bill. We know he's a mutant, and we know he killed your wife. - You shouldn't have kept that from us. - That... That has nothing to do with my work, General. Bullshit. You're too close to this. I'm shutting you down. Okay. You're right. I won't lie to you. My son did bring the problem home for me, but I took an oath to protect the American people from every threat, both foreign and domestic. - You don't like flying, huh? - I'm fine. - Just concentrate on what you're doing. - You sure? You got a bit of sweat on your brow there. Very funny. Just keep your eyes on the... On the what? The clouds? Keep my eyes on the clouds? You're up and down like a freaking yo-yo here! - Where'd you get this thing, anyway? - Oh, this is my baby. I won her in a game. Jacks over fives. Great. Relax. We're almost there. There it is. The island. Three Mile Island. Hiding in plain sight. No one's gonna snoop around a nuclear reactor. They think it's gonna turn them into freaks. - Like you? - Right. All right. You ready? Because it's now or never. Let's go. About time. Hey, if it makes you feel any better, this is really gonna hurt. Well, yeah, it kind of does, actually. - Good luck. - Likewise. Oh, shit. How you doing? Everything all right? - Is he ready yet? - A few more hours. - And he will respond to my commands? - Absolutely. Logan. Welcome back to the war. Before I gut you, I want to know why. I needed your powers for the Pool. - For the what? - The mutant killer. Deadpool. Years of searching and refining, finding the right powers that can coexist in one body without ripping it apart. My son was the first piece of the puzzle. Logan, you were the last. You made Weapon XI possible. I asked you to help, but you said you wanted the quiet life. Well, I've learned that nothing motivates the men in your family like revenge. Who are you? Oh, she's real, old friend. Did you really think we'd just let you walk away? You're a dangerous man. We like to keep an eye on dangerous men. Tell him about the day you died. They gave me a shot of hydrochlorothiazide. It reduces the heart rate so low it appears you flatlined. Don't be angry with her. She's a real credit to your species. Did you know that her sister has diamond-hard skin? Kayla's mutation is tactohypnosis. She can influence people as long as she touches them. Quite a useful tool in a seduction. It was never real, my friend. It was real for me. I told you if you came down this road, you wouldn't like what you found. That story you told me about a man who gets flowers for the moon, I had it backwards. I thought you were the moon and I was your wolverine. But you're the trickster, aren't you? I'm just the fool who got played. The worst part of it is, I should have known. But I ignored my instincts. I ignored what I really am. But that won't ever happen again. - Colonel? - Not now, Kayla. I've done everything you've asked. My sister. You said if I helped you, you'd let her go. Kayla, it's not as simple as that. Her mutation is unique. Quite beautiful. We just need a little more time to analyze it, that's all. You let him go? - Victor, please. - You can't let him go. - You can't beat him, Victor. - Then give me the Adamantium! - Your tests came back. - We had a deal! You would never survive the operation. - I can take anything he can. - No, you can't. You're my favorite soldier, Victor. Be patient. Your time will come. He's using us. How about this time you die for real? Let me go. Your little mind games don't work on me. Victor! Feels good, doesn't it? All that rage. - Do it. - Logan! - You're not an animal. - Oh, yes, you are. Do it. Finish it. Logan? My sister. They have my sister. Please. I didn't trick you into loving me. It was real for me, too. Please, I'm so sorry. They have my sister. Where is she? - Activate Weapon XI! - The bonding process isn't complete. Just do it! Now! Come on. Come on! Okay. Perfect. - Kayla, get these kids out of here. - Logan... Find another way out. Okay. Let's go. Wade, is that you? Guess Stryker finally figured out how to shut you up. Now... Wade? You don't have to do this. All right, maybe you do. You're shitting me. Shoot on sight! - I can help! Point me at them! - Go. Go! Now! - Did I get them? - Yeah. - Let's go. - I can't go. - Kayla, come on! - I have to stay here. You take them. Go! Go! /Go left. Left. - What? - We go left. - You can't see. - Trust me. Let's see you dance up here. Nobody kills you but me. Back to back! - I got him! - Oh, no, you don't. Stop! This can't be the way. - This is the way. - How do you know? I just know. Come on. Adamantium bullets. Let's see him heal with a few of these through his thick skull. You can't stop him, even with that. - He'll heal. - His brain may heal, but his memories won't grow back. This doesn't change anything between us, Victor. - We're done. - We can never be done, Jimmy. We're brothers, and brothers look out for each other. - You miss me? - Ah, Jesus. You know, when you said you were gonna kill everyone, I thought you may just have been exaggerating. Yeah. Do I look like a man who exaggerates? - You're welcome. - Logan? Logan. There's kids trying to get off the island. Split up. Go! I'm on it. Kayla! Kayla! Hey. I love you. - Hey... - I'm so cold. Listen to me. I'm gonna get you out of here. Understand? Just go easy. Nice and easy. That's it. That's it. Okay. I'm gonna get you help. Logan! I should make you pull the trigger. But that would make us no better than you. Throw the gun away. Turn around. Walk until your feet bleed. And then keep walking. /It will be all right, Scott. /My name is Charles Xavier. /I'm a mutant like you. /- I can hear your thoughts. - Yes, and I can hear yours. You're safe now. Come. We have to go. Come on, let's go. The kids are safe. Damn. - Who are you? - What do you mean, who am I? I'm the guy who brought you here. Now, we got to go. Where the hell am I? Listen to me. I'm a friend. - I'm a friend. - Yeah? What's my name? - What's my name? - Your name is Logan. You need to trust me. We have to go. Follow me. Now! Do you know her? No. Hey, these boys aren't gonna like what you've done to this place. We really need to go. I'll find my own way. Good luck. Colonel Stryker? - Colonel William Stryker? - Yes. You're wanted for questioning in connection with the death of General Munson, sir. /More wine. /Are you from America? Canadian, I think. /You don't remember /where you're from?

He won't listen to us. He's just... He's being... Scott. Let me try. Smells pretty old in here. ls this a school or a museum? One more. And last one. There you go. I'll see you guys. Watch where you're going. I can’t. Who are you talking to? Me. I just heard you in my head. I'm telepathic, I read minds. Well, stay out of mine. I don't need some weird girl creeping around in there. Don't worry, Scott. There's not much to see. Hey, wait. I didn't tell you my name. No, you didn't. Alex Summers? Hank McCoy! Whoa! What happened to the big, blue, furry you? I keep him under control now. This is my brother, Scott. Hey, Scott. I'm Hank McCoy. I'm one of the teachers here. Where’s the professor? “To break forth bloodily, then the past must be obliterated... \"and a new start made. \"Let us now start fresh... \"without remembrance... \"rather than live forward and backward at the same time.\" Now, what on earth do we think that the author meant when he wrote all that? That's going to be your assignment for tomorrow. Top marks, everyone. Class dismissed. Alex. - It’s good to see you. - You too. You look well. It's been a while. It has. Not too bad yourself. Thank you. This is my brother, Scott. Hello, Scott. Welcome to the School for the Gifted. Yeah. It doesn't exactly feel like a gift. It never does, at ﬁrst. The first step in understanding one's power... is learning the extent of it. Only then can we begin the process of teaching you how to control it. If you do decide to stay, I can promise you... that by the time you're done here, you'll be able to go back into the world... and play a stable and productive part in it. Why don’t you take your bandages off... and we can have a look at what we're dealing with here? Alex, would you line him up? Face him in the right direction, as it were. There's a target just across the water. When you open your eyes, try and hit that. You can open your eyes, Scott. There's nothing to be afraid of. It's quite... Look out! Get back! Get back! Get back! My grandfather planted that tree when he was ﬁve years old. I used to swing... from the branches of it, myself. I think that was probably my favorite tree. Does that mean I'm expelled? On the contrary. You're enrolled. Do you sell rugs? You're not allowed in this area. This rug is for sale? I said, this... Earthquake! Back to bed, please, my darling. Back to bed. She’s doing it again. Back to bed; please, everyone. Jesse, back to bed, please. Come on now. Spit-spot, back to bed. Carrie Anne, come on now. Back to bed. Never seen it like this. Nor I. Don't let any of the children come this way. Jean. Jean! Jean! I saw the end of the world. I could feel... all this death. It was just a dream. No, it felt real. I know. Your mind is the most powerful I've ever seen. It can convince itself... No. no... It's not just the mind-reading or the telekinesis... it’s something else. Some dark power inside and it's growing. Like a ﬁre. I thought I was getting better. You are. You will. You just have to be patient. No, no. You don't know what it's like to be afraid to shut your eyes. To be trapped inside your own head. Oh, I think I do. It wasn’t so long ago that I was plagued by voices, myself. All their suffering. All their pain. Their secrets. I'm afraid one day I'm going to hurt someone. Lie back. Everyone fears that which they do not understand. You will learn to control your powers. And when you do... you'll have nothing to fear. Her nightmares were different this time. It could account for something I saw when I was in my lab earlier. There was some kind of tremor. Like an energy surge I picked it up on one of my meters. You’re saying Jean created it? No. I'm saying something else did. Maybe she was reacting to it. I don't know. But the epicenter was halfway around the world. Halfway around the world? That's why I was hoping you could take a look. Let's see what we can find. Welcome, Professor. Okay, the source came from Cairo. I'll put in the coordinates. l gotta get out of here. Give them a report. What? What is it? Something happened here. l can tell them it's real. It's her. Who? - Moira. - What? Moira MacTaggert? Give me the details. She looks amazing. She’s barely aged a day. No. I meant... What is she doing there? What does the CIA want with this? She’s going back to Langley to deliver a report. I'm going to go there... see if she knows something about the tremor. And you want to go see Moira. I want to go check her out. Check out... the situation. Moira MacTaggert. It's like a ghost from the past. You did a good thing. You saved that man. That's not the point. If I'm exposed, we’re all exposed. We have to go. This is our home. This is our daughter's home. We are her home. I told you who I was, the first night I met you. I trusted you then. I need you to trust me now. We can't stay here anymore. I'll get Nina. Sweetheart. She’s not in her room. And I don't see her out back. Nina? Nina! Nina! Nina! Nina! Nina. Are you alright? She's ﬁne. Then let her go! We will. We just wanted to have a word You’re not wearing your badges. No metal. Some guys at the factory said they saw something today. Something that didn’t add up. Put your weapons away. You've been a good citizen, Henryk... A good neighbor... a good worker. I want to believe that's who you are. It is. But nobody in this town really knows you. Yes you do. I am Henryk Gurzsky. Jakob, I've had dinner in your home... And you were lying the whole time. I brought a killer into my house. ls this you? Are you the one they call Magneto? Take me in. Please... Just let my daughter go. Go with your mother. Please.! Don't leave me. I'm not going to let them take you. Nina. Nina. Nina. What's going on? She’s one of them? Tell her to stop! She can’t control it! She’s scared of you! I'm not going to let them take you! Make her stop! Nina! Nina! Nina. Nina, Nina. no... No, please. Please! Please. Please. Not my babies. Not my babies. ls this what you want from me? ls this what I am? ls this what I am? You know what we do to thieves. Pick a hand. Enough. If you're with her, I suggest you walk away. While you still can. Walk away Who rules this world? What language is that? Clown-face. What's the deal? Beat it! I'm sorry. You can't feel it, can you? Now you feel it. So you really haven't seen her in all these years\" You never looked her up? Not even in Cerebro? Alex! What do you take me for, some kind of pervert? Yes, I looked her up once. Twice. But not in a long time, all right? How did you leave things? Any hard feelings? Not likely. Everybody take a break. I wiped her mind of all memories of us. The beach, Cuba... that whole time. It was so long ago, Alex. Before the world knew about mutants. I felt it was the best thing for her. And for you? Didn't really matter what was best for me. Moira... MacTaggert, hello! Allow me to introduce myself. - I’m Professor... - Charles Xavier. - I know exactly who you are. - You do? Of course I do. I have read all of your papers. It's a pleasure to finally meet you. Moira MacTaggert. - Alex Summers. - Have a seat Just throw that on the floor. It's wonderful to see you again. To meet you again, for the first time. You've got a son? Yes. Does he have a husband? Do you have a husband? I had a husband... but it's hard to do this job and make it home in time for dinner. Good, good. We all make choices, right? Yes, we do. - Professor. - Yes'? Yes. I was, we were hoping that you would... tell us about what happened yesterday in Egypt. I'm afraid that's classiﬁed information. I don't mean to be rude... but how did you get in here? I have level-five clearance. Ever since the world found out about mutants in '73... there have been cults who see them as some kind of... Second Coming or sign of God. I was tracking one of them. They call themselves Ashir En Sabah Nur... named after an ancient being they believe to be the world's first. The world's first what? The world's first mutant. I thought mutants didn't evolve until this century. That's the common theory, yes, but these guys believe... that the first mutant was born tens of thousands of years ago. And they believe he will rise again. They've been searching ancient sites all around the world for clues These hieroglyphs... describe a specific set of powers greater than any man could possess. They think he lived all that time? Yes and no They believe he had the ability... to transfer his consciousness from body to body. And whenever he was close to death... he would just take on a new body. Some of these may have been the bodies of mutants enabling him to take their powers... amassing various abilities over the years. - An all-powerful mutant. - Exactly. And wherever this being was he always had four... principle followers. Disciples. Protectors he would imbue with powers. Like the Four Horsemen... of the Apocalypse. He got that one from the Bible. Or the Bible got it from him. And wherever he ruled... eventually, it would end in disaster. Cataclysm. Some kind of... Apocalypse The end of the world. l must say, Apollo... the way you ape human behavior is remarkable. I am Apollo. I've never seen another mutant in this town. You speak Egyptian? Arabic? English? l'm a scientist. My particular specialty... Great ﬁghter. She’s my hero. I want to be like her. There's some food here. Not much. I don't believe it. You love me. Love you? Illogical. I'm not some simple shepherdess you can awe. Why, I could no more love you... than I could love a new species of bacteria What are you doing? Learning. In the streets, there is outrage against the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan... ...in a brotherhood of our kind. Several demonstrations. One of them was held in Boston, and Bruce Morton has the story. Since the advent of nuclear weapons, the United States does not start ﬁghts. Weapons. Never before has man possessed so much power. Soviet Union and United States being superpowers... Superpowers. The weak... have taken the earth. For this, I was betrayed. False gods. Idols. No more. I have returned. A new tomorrow... that starts today. Where did you come from? A time before man lost his way. Welcome to the '80s. This world needs to be... Cleansed. What? Saved. You can't save the world... just going around killing people. There’s laws, systems in place... for that kind of thing. My child .. why do you enslave yourself? What are you doing? Making you stronger. My goddess. Aphrodite. You were right. Yes. You were right. The time is past. There is no room for gods. Why can’t I go with you? I told you, I work alone. Wait there. Always good to see your face. Even if it’s not yours. Papers and passage for one. Where’s the gentleman going, if I may ask? Don't know, don’t care. l just save his life. What he does with it is up to him. Mystique, the mercenary. Don't call me that. No matter how much you pretend to be someone else .. Caliban knows who you are. If there's anything worth knowing about mutants... Caliban knows it. Mystique. Why don’t you ask your psychics... what'll happen to you if you keep pushing me? What'll happen? Psylocke gets a little jealous. But Caliban likes you. Caliban likes money. Caliban likes you so much... he wants to give you free information... about an old friend... from back when you had friends. Do you remember... Erik Lehnsherr? My girls got a flash of him in Poland. He left quite a few dead bodies in his wake... including his wife and daughter. Should be in the news soon enough... but Caliban gives you a little head start. - How fast are you? - How fast? How far can you cover? As far as I can see or if I've been there before. Come with me, Crawler. Actually, it's Nightcrawler. And my real name is... Kurt Wagner. The lenses are made of some ruby quartz I had lying around. They should be able to refract your optic beams... and keep them contained within their own vector fields. Try them on. Okay. Go ahead. Wait, sorry, no. Okay. - Now? - Yeah, you're good. All right. Whoa. I can see. Thank you. Professor, thank you You're a genius. No. I'm not a professor. I wish... Who's that? I believe you two met. That's Jean Grey. You bumped into her when you arrived. - Wait; that's her? - Yeah. Hey. You can see. Yeah. It's not as bad as I thought here. Freak. - Someone should warn the new kid. - Yeah. Someone should tell him. They're still scared of me. Hey, I have special glasses now. They're not scared of you. They're scared of me. You're not the only one who can't fully control your powers. Wait, so... last night, when the house shook... that was you? Sorry to break it to you, but you're not the biggest freak in the school. Well, that's a first. Raven. Wow. I.. You’re... Not blue? Looks like you and I have that in common, now. No, no, I meant... you're back. Never thought I'd see you here again. Yeah, me neither. I'm blue. I'm Kurt. Oh, right. Kurt Wagner. Welcome. We’re closed. I knew I felt a chill in the air. How did you get in here? We let ourselves in. We are looking for mutants. Since you know where to find them, we came here Caliban doesn't know you. We’re looking for the strongest. Everything all right? I'm fine, Psylocke. How much money do you have? None. Like Caliban said... we are closed. Yeah? I need your help, my child. You don't look like Caliban's father. Maybe a little bit up here. You are all my children... and you're lost, because you follow blind leaders. These false gods... systems of the weak. They've ruined my world... No more. What do you want? I want you... to feel the full reach of your power. You've only had a taste of your true strength Unlike others... who seek to control you... I want to set you free. I know the kind of mutants you're making for. And I know where to find them. It's my ﬁrst time in America. I'm very excited to see your culture. Well, you're not gonna see it here. The only thing American about this place is that it used to be British. This is Scott. He's new here, too. And I'm already up for a prison break. What do we say, we take this blue guy on a little field trip? I'm sure there’s a mall around here, somewhere. What's a mall? What's a mall? All right, now this is a matter of national pride. Civic duty. Scott. What? You’ve been cooped up here for a longtime... and the Professor's not even home. I'd like to go to the mall. Try it. All right. Where does he keep his cars? Or should I say \"piss off\"? This is the guy? He used to be. I didn't know his wings were... Let's get out of here. His fighting days are done. No, they're not. What the hell is this? I want to give you something. There's nothing you can give me that I want. Yes, there is. Yes, my son. Yes. Rise, my angel. Rise. Wow. Hypersonic, blast resistant, stealth technology. That's impressive. How are you ever gonna get it out of here? Well, that's okay. I built a retractable roof into the basketball court. Hank, you're building a warplane down here. After what happened in Washington, I thought we were going to come back... and start the X-Men, like we all used to talk about. But... Charles wants students, not soldiers. And he thinks the best of people. He has hope. And you? You know, I think we should hope for the best. And prepare for the worst. I think the world needs the X-Men. And maybe now that you're back, you could help me convince him. We could start it together. Hank, I'm here about Erik. Right Erik. Yeah. Of course. Of course. l think he might be in some kind of trouble. Real trouble. Isn't he always? Some of you spoke to the police... about what you believe you witnessed here yesterday. You want to know my powers... know who I am... see what I can do? I'll show you. Think of the person you love most in your life. Your wife. Mother. Daughter. Now that person will know what it is to lose someone they love. And live with that pain. Forever. Henryk, please. Don't do this. My name isn’t Henryk. My name is Magneto. Who the fuck are you? Stay back. Whoever you are... don't try to stop me from killing these men. I'm not here for them. I'm here for you. Come and see. This is where your power was born. And this is where your people were slaughtered. You shouldn't have brought me here. Why? Are you afraid to be here? You can't escape it, Erik. Who are you? Elohim, Shen, Ra. I've been called many names over many lifetimes. I am born of death. I was there to spark... and fan the ﬂame of man’s awakening. To spin the wheel of civilization. And when the forest would grow rank... and needed clearing for new growth... I was there to set it ablaze. Where were you... when my father and mother were slaughtered in this place? Asleep. Trapped in darkness. I was not there for you, my son. But I am here now. You don't know your own strength, but I do. Reach down. Feel the metal... in the ground. Reach as deep as you can. You'll find you have the power... to move the very Earth itself. Everything they've built will fall! And from the ashes of their world... we'll build a better one! Lehnsherr was identified yesterday, in this small town in central Poland. Leaders from all communities are urging their citizens to remain calm. As police and armed forces are mobilizing to ﬁnd Lehnsherr... ...before he can strike again. If anyone has information about Lehnsherr... or as he is also known, Magneto... contact your local authorities immediately... and proceed with caution... - as he is considered extremely... - Peter What's up? Just checking on you. I'm good. Playing Pac-Man. You sure you weren’t watching this? This news comes at a time when the world is celebrating 10 years of peace... between mutants and mankind. You’re going after him, aren’t you? You wanted me to get out of the house more, right? I can't stop you. Nobody can. But trust me, this won't end well. Nothing does with him. I'm not afraid of him. You should be. I've read so much about this place. But being here, it actually seems kind of... familiar. Strange. Quite. Shall we? I'm just saying, Empire is still the best. It's the most complex. the most sophisticated... wasn't afraid to have a dark ending. Yeah, but come on. If it wasn't for the ﬁrst one... you wouldn’t have any of the rest of the movies. Well, at least we can all agree, the third one's always the worst. Hank. Are you in here? I'd like you to meet... Moira. Raven. I'm sorry, have we met? Hank, Alex, Agent MacTaggert... would you give us just one moment, please? Of course. Charles, why didn't she recognize me? She knew me in this form. Well, after you left me on the beach in Cuba... I took her memories of that time. Have a seat Lucky girl. It's good to see you, Raven. Welcome home - This isn't my home. It was once. No, it was your home. l just lived here. And I barely even recognize it now. You know, I have plans for this place. I mean to turn it into a real campus. A university. Not just for mutants, either, for humans too. Living and working... growing together. You know, I really believed that once. I really believed we could change them after DC. We did. No, Charles. They still hate and fear us. It's just harder to see because they're more polite about it. I got sick of living that lie. That's why you're not in your natural blue form. I'm not gonna be the face of a world that doesn't exist. Things are better. The world is better. Maybe in Westchester. Out there, mutants are still running... hiding, living in fear. Just because there's not a war, doesn't mean there's peace. You want to teach your kids something, teach them that Teach them to fight. Otherwise they might as well live in this house for the rest of their lives. You still sound just like him. You sound just like Erik. That's why I'm here. He's resurfaced. He had a wife and a child. They were killed. Along with a handful of policemen. The whole world will be looking for him. But you can help me find him before they do. Moira, I'm going to have to ask you to keep this a secret. I don't even know what this is. It's Cerebro. The new model. I based the color on... It doesn't matter. What are those? Those are all the humans of the world. And these... are all the mutants. I'm connected to all of their minds. The CIA would kill for this. I know they would. Where are you, Erik? Charles? Hello, old friend. I'm sorry. I am so sorry! I feel your pain. And your loss. You think because you can see into my head... you know how it feels? You're looking in the wrong place, Charles. What happened to them, it was terribly wrong. But come back to us. l can help you. Help me? Think of your wife, think of your daughter. What wound they have wanted? They would have wanted to live. l tried your way, Charles. l tried to be like them. Live like them. But it always ends the same way. They took everything away from me. Now... we'll take everything from them. Hank .. he’s not alone. Extraordinary. What do you see? The answer. Hey, Charles, wait. Oh, my God. Thank you for letting me in. Charles, get out! I've never felt power like this before. Charles... Charles, get out of there. What's going on? What's happening? l think... Someone's taken over Cerebro. - They've taken control of it. - To do what? To connect. Always the same. And now, all this. No more stones. No more spears. No more slings. No more swords. No more weapons! No more systems! No more! No more superpowers. Charles! Hank! What the hell is going on? Who's turning the keys? The men are. Who green-lit the launch? Hank, do something! It won't shut down! We’ve lost contact with all Trident and Polaris subs. The Air Force is reporting the same thing. So much faith in their tools... and their machines. Russia, China... England, Israel, India. Everybody's got nukes in the air. What's the target? Where are they going? Up. straight up. Alex... - What? - Destroy it! Destroy everything. Destroy Cerebro! Wreak havoc! You can ﬁre your arrows... from the Tower of Babel... but you can never strike God! Charles, are you okay? Erik. Charles! Alex! Hey! Hey, asshole! All will be revealed, my child. Stop! No! Wow! Where did you... I was looking for the Professor. I thought he lived here. They took him. She’s the one. It's her. Are you sure? ls she gonna help us? They look up to you. Right now... they need you. That's not what they need. That's awesome! What happened? Where’s Alex? Where's my brother? Pretty sure I got everybody. Alex was closest to the blast. Alex... We're one click out. All right, boys. This is it. Scott. Medical assistance is on the way. Please remain calm. Medical assistance is on the way. Please remain calm. Medical assistance is on the way. Please remain calm. Medical assistance is on the way. Hey! Moira MacTaggert! CIA! Thank God you're here! Wait! Fire! I want her. Him. Him. - And her. - Yes, sir. Leave the kids. - What do we do? - Keep quiet X-Ray 7, I'm doing a final sweep of the ground. Let's get them on the bird! Clear! Thanks, Jean. We gotta help them. - Kurt, can you get us in that thing? - You want to get in there? What if the soldiers see us? Don't worry, they won't see us. Trust me. Hold on. Kurt, get us all out of here! I can't! When they closed the doors, there's some kind of electrical field. It's like Berlin all over. Jean, get in the pilots' heads. Don’t let them take off. I can't I can't reach the pilots. I can't reach anyone We're also getting reports out of Europe and Asia. This was not just a U.S. phenomenon. It seems the entire world has been disarmed of nuclear weapons. The Pentagon has conﬁrmed multiple launches... from Russia, as well as the UK, Israel and China. - Look! - Look up there! So far, there has been no response from the White House. Eyewitness reports have been pouring in from afﬁliates across the globe. Authorities are not sure if it was an act of peace or an act of war. Our dear Father... hold me in the light of God. It should have been me. He was the one that was gonna do something with his life. He was always the one. That's not how he felt. He felt you were the one that was gonna do something special with your life. That you were gonna make a difference in the world. Maybe even change it. How do you know what he felt? I know what everybody feels. Hold me in the light of God. Protect me from danger. Save me by Your command. Listen to my prayer. And keep me safe. You’re blocking me. How? I can shield their minds from your power. It's one of the many gifts I've acquired throughout the millennia. But to see... inside a mind... to control it... that's your gift. You saw it, didn't you? The glory of what's to come. You’re going to take part in all this killing and destruction? It's all I've ever known. No, it isn’t. You've just forgotten. No, Charles, I remember. Your way doesn’t work. I've shown him a better way. A better world. No, you've just tapped into his rage and pain. That's all you've done I told you from the moment I met you, there is more to you? Erik. There is good in you, too. Whatever it is you think you saw in me, Charles... I buried it... with my family. What? What's wrong with you? ls that going to happen to all of us? No, l just... left my meds in the house. What happened? Where are we? Hey! Hello, Mystique. Major Stryker. Colonel Stryker. I wouldn't get too close to the wall, if I were you. It may create some discomfort. I'm Moira MacTaggert. I'm a senior ofﬁcer at the CIA. l know who you are, Agent MacTaggert. You cannot keep me here, in this... Actually, I can. A psychic event just destroyed every nuke from here to Moscow. That event emanated from exactly where we found you. At the home of the world's most powerful psychic. So, you are going to tell me, where is Charles Xavier? It's not him you should be worried about. There's someone else. Someone more powerful. If you let us out of here, we can help you. Do you really expect me to believe that? You can put on any face that you want, but l know who you are. What you are. Hey, Moira. What did you mean when you said... someone more powerful than Charles? Once they finish these. we'll go from there. What's taking so long? I can't get in. They have a ﬁeld around it, like the helicopter. There's gotta be a way to cut the power. Charles... you will send a message... to every living mind. You will tell them that this earth will be laid waste. That it is I, En Sabah Nur... who will wreak this upon them. Now. deliver my message. Even if I wanted to... I couldn’t reach that many people. I don't have Cerebro. You don't need a machine... to amplify your powers. You have me. Guys, that could be our way out of here. You know him? Magneto? I used to. Not so sure anymore. What was he like? Was he like they say he was? Was he... the bad guy? No. I mean, yeah. He was... Why do you care so much? You see his speech on TV or something? Yeah, but... He's my father. What? - Him and my mom, they did it. - No, I know... Are you sure? Yeah. He left my mom before l was born. I met him 10 years back... but I didn't know it was him. By the time I figured it out, it was too late. Then, this week I saw him on TV again... and I came to that house, looking for him... but by the time I got there... Late again. For a guy who moves as fast as me... I always seem to be too late. Let's hope not this time. Yeah. Seriously. Hear me... inhabitants of this world. - What is that? - This is a message. I think it’s the Professor. A message to every man, woman, and mutant in the world. You have lost your way. You have lost your way. But I have returned. But I have returned. The day of reckoning is here. All your buildings... ...all of your towers and temples... Will fall. And the dawn of a new age will rise. ...for there is nothing you can do... - Jean. - ...to stop what is coming. Jean, if you can hear me, focus on my voice. Cairo. Find us, Jean. Find us. Cairo. Find us. This message is for one reason alone. To tell the strongest among you... Those with the greatest power... this earth will be yours. Those with the greatest power... protect those without. That's my message to the world. How was Charles doing that without Cerebro? Sir, what was that voice? I know that voice. It's Xavier, isn't it? What's going on? - We don’t know! - We don't know, bro! He just spoke to me. I think he spoke to everyone. - I could hear him, too. - No. no... he just sent me a hidden message. One he knew only I would hear. I know where they are. Hey! We have shots ﬁred! Where's it coming from? I have intruders in Quad Six. Send a security team. Take them out The generator. It's worth a shot. Kurt? There's some kind of animal in there. It's no animal. It's a man. Who is he? That part of him as been taken away. What do you mean? I mean they turned him into some kind of weapon. Charlie Three, report. Did you find them? Shut it down. Fire! Weapon X is loose! I repeat, Weapon X is loose! You sure he's not an animal? - He's into the central halls. - Engaging target Sector Five. We can't... Hey! What are they doing? What's going on? - I just lost feed. - Hey! What's going on here? I'll be right back. No! Hey! Stay where you are! Scott, wait. l can help you. Jean. Logan. What'd you do to him? I found a piece of his past and gave it back to him. Just the few memories I could reach. I hope that's the last we’ve seen of that guy. Kurt. - What? - What? Hey. Stay away from the... The what? The do-... Stay away from the... Get away from the door! On three. One... two... We know where the Professor is. I think we might have a way out of here. - Well you've been busy. - We had a little help. Let's go! Jesus! Oh. sorry! This way! This was meant to be the center of the universe... before I was betrayed. Now... it will be. Nice. Hey, Hank, do you think you can ﬂy this thing? Yeah, I can figure it out. Hey, guys. Flight suits. You got your warplane. Let's go to war. A gift. from the past you left behind... and the future that lies ahead. You will reach down, my son. Deep into the earth. Rip everything they've built from the ground. Wipe clean this world. And we will lead those that survive... into a better one. And me? Am I to play a role in this madness? You have the most important role of all. Were you scared? That day in D.C., were you scared? No. But I was scared on my first mission. I was on a plane like this with my friends. About your age. We called ourselves the X-Men. Your brother was there. We used to call him Havok. He was a real handful... but when it came down to it, he was very brave. What happened to the rest of the kids who went with you? The X-Men? Hank and I are the only ones left. I couldn't save the rest of them. I told you? I'm not a hero. Well, you're a hero to us. Seeing you that day on TV... changed my life. Mine, too. Mine, too. I still live in my mom's basement but. you know... everything else is... It's pretty much the same. I'm a total loser. What we’re seeing is a magnetic phenomenon... on a much larger scale than what we saw at Auschwitz. The ground is full of magnetic elements. Iron, nickel, cobalt. The ocean's floor is lined with them, too. It's already begun at the lowest depths. Land masses will slow it, but not for long. Eventually, cities, urban centers... anything built since the Bronze Age... will be wiped away. The death toll will be in the billions. He's talking about the whole goddamn world. You’re just another false god. And whoever's left to follow you when this all over they will betray you again. You’re wrong, Charles. For the first time in a thousand lifetimes... I have you. For all my gifts, I have yet to possess the one I needed most. To be.. everywhere. To be.. everyone. Seventh wonder, twelve o'clock. He has the Professor in the center of the pyramid. He's going to transfer his consciousness into the Professor. If he does that... he'll have the power to control every mind in the world. What the hell is that? It's Erik. You guys help Nightcrawler get into the pyramid. Get Charles. I'll take care of Erik. How are we gonna get through that? I can get you in there. I came here for him. Let me help you. The rest of you, get Charles on this plane and get him out of here. - We're not leaving without you! - Don't worry. We'll catch up. Hold on. Hank, you go with the kids. - Moira will be waiting on the plane. - Wait. What? Not all of us can fully control our powers. Then don’t. You need to embrace them. We all do. Go Join the others. Protect me, until the transference is complete. There's an entrance. It's clear. Kurt! Get in there! In the pyramid! Move! Go! Split them up. Professor... Kurt, you have to hurry! I'm trying. It's like a maze in here. Kurt no! The magnetic field is too strong. I can't get us in there. Erik! Mystique. I know you think you've lost everything. But you haven’t. You have me. You have Charles. You have more family than you know. You never had the chance to save your family before. But you do now. That's what I've come here to tell you. And you? I'm your... I'm here for my family, too. Get out. Get out! Get out! Auf Wiedersehen. We’re losing him. I'll be right back. Scott, glasses on! Let's go! - Locked on. - Here we go. Psylocke! What the hell was that? Kurt. Everyone, grab hold of Nightcrawler! I've never done it with this many people. Get us out of here. Kurt, hurry! Kurt! Charles... ls he okay? It's his energy. He’s drained. Get out. Get out! Professor, it’s okay. You're with us. It's okay. I'm going to fight for what I have left. Are you? There's so much more to you than you know. Not just pain and anger. There's good, too. I felt it. It's not just me you're walking away from. Here, you have the chance to be a part of something much bigger than yourself. And it needs you? Erik. Useless. Charles. I know you can hear me. We're still connected. Charles! Show yourself! Charles! Show yourself! Foolish child. Peter. End him. Raven. The great hero. - I’m going out there. - I'm going with you. No. It's me he wants. Charles, you can't give yourself up. If he has you, he has us all. The whole world. You are feeble. Just like the others. Charles! Come! Rescue your weaklings! Give your life for theirs! No. He was right. There is still some part of me connected to him. Charles! I can get inside his head. Will you do nothing? Thank you for letting me in. You want what I have? You want to feel what I feel? Welcome to my world! You’re in my house now! You'll need a bigger house. You betray me? No. I betrayed them. Let's jump. What? Cover me. l got you. Come on! They lack strength, Charles. Jean. Come here. Help... me. Stay here. They can't stop him. Jean. Help me! Hank! Hank! It's over, Charles. You're ﬁnished. You're mine now. You will never win. And why is that? Because you are alone. And I am not! Let... go. Unleash your power, Jean. No fear. Unleash your power! Let go, Jean! Jean, let go! He's getting away. All is revealed. Charles! Charms! - We've lost him! - Charles. - He's gone. - No, Charles. Charles... No. he's not. I can still feel him. Thank you, Jean. Charles? Charles, do you know where you are? I'm on a beach. In Cuba. With you. What beach? Charles Xavier. I'm sorry. I should never have taken those from you Hold on! What did I miss? It seems only by the grace of God... that the ominous destruction... seen from one end of the globe to the other, has stopped. At a debrieﬁng today, CIA Special Agent Moira MacTaggert... revealed to an investigative committee... The committee was further stunned to learn that fugitive Erik Lehnsherr... aided in defeating this powerful and unknown... I think our prayers were answered. Thank you, Mr. President. The potential destructive power of mutants... ...is sure to fuel new controversy and debate... at a time when mutants were becoming accepted around the world. Mystique told me he is your father. Are you gonna tell him? I might... one day. I think for now, I'm just gonna stick around here for a while. Me, too. The world's already begun rebuilding its arsenals. It's human nature, Charles. I still have hope. Oh, yes. \"Hope.\" I was right about Raven. I was even right about you. What about the rest of the world? Doesn't it ever wake you up in the middle of the night? The feeling that one day they'll come for you... and your children. It does, indeed. What do you do when you wake up to that? I feel a great swell of pity for the poor soul... that comes to my school looking for trouble. You’re sure I can't convince you to stay? You’re psychic, Charles. You can convince me to do anything. Goodbye, old friend. Good luck, Professor. Forget everything you think you know. Whatever lessons you learned in school whatever your parents taught you. None of that matters! You’re not kids anymore. You're not students. You're X-Men.", "url": "https://subslikescript.com/movie/X-Men_Apocalypse-3385516"},

Wolverine. Charles Xavier, who owns a school for young mutants, sends Storm and Cyclops to bring them back before it is too late. Magneto, who believes a war is approaching, has an evil plan in mind, and needs young Rogue to help him.", "transcript": "foodval.com - stop by if you're interested in the nutritional composition of food   ---  \n        Mutation: it is the key to our evolution. It has enabled us to evolve into the dominant species on the planet. This process normally takes thousands and thousands of years. But every few hundred millennia, evolution leaps forward. Niagara Falls, up the Canadian Rockies, and then it's only a few hundred miles to Anchorage. - Won't it kinda be cold? - Well, that's the point, stupid. Otherwise it wouldn't be an adventure. And when are you gonna do this? I don't know. \n \n \n \n    (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n \n After high school. Before college. - Marie! - I don't know what happened. - David? - I don't know... I just touched him. - I didn't mean... - Call an ambulance! We only touched. Just get away from me! - Will you call an ambulance?! - Don't touch me! We are now seeing the beginnings of another stage of human evolution. These mutations manifest at puberty, often triggered by periods of emotional stress. Thank you, Miss Grey. It was quite educational. However, it fails to address the issue that is the focus of this hearing. Three words: are mutants dangerous? That's unfair, Senator Kelly. The wrong person driving a car can be dangerous. - We do license people to drive. - Yes, but not to live. Senator, mutants who've come forward and revealed themselves publicly \n \n \n \n    (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n \n have been met with fear, hostility, even violence. It is because of that hostility that I am urging the Senate to vote against mutant registration. - To force mutants to expose themselves... - Expose themselves? What do mutants have to hide that makes them so afraid to identify themselves? - I didn't say they were hiding. - Let me show you what is being hidden. I have here a list of names of identified mutants... ...living right here in the United States. - Senator Kelly... - A girl in Illinois who walks through walls. What's to stop her from walking into a bank vault? Or into the White House? Or into their houses? And there are even rumours of mutants so powerful that they can enter our minds and control our thoughts, taking away our God-given free will. The American people deserve the right to decide whether they want their children to be in school with mutants. To be taught by mutants. Ladies and gentlemen, the truth is that mutants are very real. And they are among us. We must know who they are, and, above all, we must know what they can do. Eric. What are you doing here? Why do you ask questions to which you already know the answers? - Don't give up on them, Eric. - What would you have me do, Charles? I've heard these arguments before. It was a long time ago. Mankind has evolved since then. Yes... into us. Are you sneaking around in here, Charles? Whatever are you looking for? I'm looking for hope. I will bring you hope, old friend. And I ask only one thing in return. Don't get in my way. We are the future, Charles, not them! They no longer matter. This is it. Where are we? I thought you said you were gonna take me as far as Laughlin City. This is Laughlin City. Gentlemen, in all my years I've never seen anything like this. Are you gonna let this man walk away with your money? No! I'll fight him! Ladies and gentlemen, our saviour! Don't hit him in the balls. - You said anything goes. - Anything goes, but he'll take it personal. You idiot! Ladies and gentlemen, tonight's winner and still King of the Cage, the Wolverine. You want something new, honey? Or are you sticking with water? I'll have a beer. Ellis Island, once the arrival point for American immigrants, is opening its doors again. Preparations are nearly completed for the United Nations World Summit. The event promises to be the largest single gathering of world leaders in history. Leaders will discuss issues ranging from the world's economy and weapons treaties, to the mutant phenomenon and its impact on our world stage. American legislators contend that debate over mutant issues should be the primary focus of what is, on the surface at least, a diplomatic affair. - You owe me some money. - Stu, let's not do this. No man takes a beating like that without a mark to show for it. - Come on, this isn't worth it. - I know what you are. You lost your money. You keep this up, you lose something else. Look out! Get outta my bar, freak! - What the hell are you doin'? - I'm sorry. I needed a ride. - I thought you might help me. - Get out! - Where am I supposed to go? - I don't know. - You don't know or you don't care? - Pick one. - I saved your life! - No, you didn't. You don't have anything to eat, do you? I'm Rogue. Were you in the army? Doesn't that mean you were in the army? - Wow! - What? - Suddenly my life isn't bad. - If you prefer the road... No! It looks great. It looks cosy. Put your hands on the heater. - I'm not gonna hurt you, kid. - It's nothing personal. It's just when people touch my skin, something happens. What? I don't know. They just get hurt. Fair enough. When they come out, does it hurt? Every time. So what kind of a name is Rogue? I don't know. What kind of a name is Wolverine? My name's Logan. Marie. - You should wear your seat belt. - Look, kid, I don't need advice on... You all right? - Kid, are you all right? - I'm stuck! Weren't you supposed to bring someone back with you? - What happened? - They knew. Charles... - Where is the mutant now? - With them. I have made the first move. That is all they know. Come, the UN summit is approaching. Time for our little test. Where's he going? Where are you going? Over here! - Where are you going? - This way! He's over there. Let go! What's your hurry? Over here! Good morning, Logan. So, I'd like your definitions of weak and strong anthropic principles on Wednesday. That'll be all. - Bye, Professor. - Bye, Kitty. Physics. I'm Charles Xavier. Would you like some breakfast? - Where am I? - Westchester, New York. You were attacked. My people brought you here for medical attention. - I don't need medical attention. - Yes, of course. - Where's the girl? - Rogue's here. She's fine. Really? Ah. Logan, I'd like you to meet Ororo Monroe, also called Storm. This is Scott Summers, also called Cyclops. They saved your life. I believe you've already met Dr Jean Grey. You're in my school for the gifted. For mutants. You'll be safe here from Magneto. - What's a magneto? - A very powerful mutant, who believes a war is brewing between mutants and the rest of humanity. I've been following his activities for some time. The man who attacked you is an associate of his called Sabretooth. Sabretooth? Storm. What do they call you? Wheels? This is the stupidest thing I've ever heard. And Cyclops, right? You wanna get outta my way? Logan, it's been almost 15 years, hasn't it? Living from day to day, moving from place to place, with no memory of who or what you are. Shut up! Give me a chance. I may be able to help you find some answers. - How do you know? - You're not the only one with gifts. - Where are you going? - Where's he going? Over here! What is this place? Anonymity is a mutant's first defence against the world's hostility. Hey, no powers! To the public, we're merely a school for gifted youngsters. Cyclops, Storm and Jean were some of my first students. I protected them, taught them to control their powers and, in time, teach others to do the same. The students are mostly runaways - frightened, alone. Some with gifts so extreme they're a danger to themselves and those around them. Like your friend Rogue. Incapable of physical human contact, probably for the rest of her life. And yet here she is with others her own age, learning, being accepted, not feared. - John! - Sorry. I'm Bobby. - What's your name? - Rogue. - What'll happen to her? - That's up to her. Rejoin the world as an educated young woman, or stay on to teach others. To become what the children have affectionately called \"X-Men\". Welcome to Mutant High. But the school is merely our public face. The lower levels, however, are an entirely different matter. When I was a boy I discovered I had the power to control people's minds. Make them think or do whatever I wanted. When I was 17 I met a young man named Eric Lensherr. He, too, had an unusual power. He could create magnetic fields and control metal. Believing that humanity would never accept us, he grew angry and vengeful. He became Magneto. There are mutants out there with incredible powers, Logan. And many who do not share my respect for mankind. If no one is equipped to oppose them, humanity's days could be over. I'll make a deal with you. Give me 48 hours to find out what Magneto wants with you, and I give you my word that I will use all my power to help you piece together what you've lost, and what you're looking for. Senator, you favour gun registration, yes? Some of these so-called children possess more than 10 times the destructive force of any handgun. No, I don't see a difference. All I see are weapons in our schools. Well, that's fair enough. All right. So? It's gonna be close. A vote this loaded is always close. What about the UN summit? The world will be watching. - Maybe you could use it to your advantage. - We're Americans, Henry. Let the rest of the damn world deal with mutants in their own way. You know this situation? These mutants? People like this Jean Grey? If it were up to me, I'd lock 'em all away. It's a war. It's the reason people like me exist. Where the hell are we? Pilot! People like you are the reason I was afraid to go to school as a child. I'm sorry. - For what? - If I hurt you. So... couldn't wait to get my shirt off again, huh? The metal is an alloy called adamantium. Supposedly indestructible. It's been surgically grafted to his entire skeleton. How could he have survived a procedure like that? His mutation. He has uncharted regenerative capability which enables him to heal rapidly. This also makes his age impossible to determine. He could very well be older than you, Professor. - Who did this to him? - He doesn't know. Nor does he remember anything about his life before it happened. Experimentation on mutants. It's not unheard of. But I've never seen anything like this before. What do you think Magneto want with him? I'm not entirely sure it's him Magneto wants. Toad has a wicked tongue, Senator. Just like you. Who are you people? Where's Henry? Mr Guyrich has been dead for some time, Senator. But I've had Mystique here keep you company. She takes so many shapes. Whatever you do to me, you'll make me right. Every word I've spoken will be confirmed. Are you a God-fearing man, Senator? It's such a strange phrase. I've always thought of God as a teacher. As a bringer of light, wisdom and understanding. You see, I think what you really are afraid of is me. Me and my kind. The brotherhood of mutants. It's not so surprising, really. Mankind has always feared what it doesn't understand. Well, don't fear God, Senator, and certainly don't fear me. Not any more. - What do you intend to do to me? - Let's just say God works too slowly. I think you'll be comfortable here. - Where's your room? - With Scott, down the hall. Is that your gift? Putting up with that guy? Actually I'm telekinetic. I can move things with my mind. Really? What kinds of things? All kinds of things. - I also have telepathic ability. - Like your professor? Nowhere near that powerful. But he's teaching me to develop it. I'm sure he is. - So read my mind. - I'd rather not. - Come on. You afraid you might like it? - I doubt it. What do you see? Scott! Good night, Logan. You gonna tell me to stay away from your girl? If I had to do that, she wouldn't be my girl. Then I guess you've got nothing to worry about, do you... Cyclops? It must just burn you up that a boy like me saved your life, huh? You oughta be careful. I might not be there next time. Oh, and Logan, stay away from my girl. Logan? Logan! Logan, wake up. Help me! Somebody, help! Scott, grab a pillow. It was an accident. - Logan? - What happened? - Is she all right? - She'll be all right. - What did she do to me? - When Rogue touches someone, she takes their energy, their life force. In the case of mutants, she absorbs their gifts for a while. In your case, your ability to heal. It felt like she almost killed me. If she'd held out any longer, she could have. How are we feeling, Senator? Advanced, I hope. What the hell have you done to me? Senator, this is pointless. Where would you go? Who would take you in, now you're one of us? Tommy, let it go! Tommy, please let it go! I'm telling Mommy. Is that a mutant? ...UN summit. With the leaders of over 200 nations attending, the Secret Service has transformed Ellis Island into a veritable Fort Knox for tomorrow night's opening gala. Ellis Island rests less than one mile from... Rogue! Bobby! Rogue, what did you do? They say you're stealing other mutants' powers. No! I borrowed his power. You never use your power against another mutant. I had no choice. - No, you have to understand... - If I were you I'd get myself outta here. - What do you mean? - Listen, the students are freaked. Professor Xavier's furious. I don't know what he'll do with you. I think it'll be easier on your own. You should go. What are you looking for, Eric? It's strange. There are more powerful mutants out there. Why should this one be so important to him? - Maybe it's his way with people. - You don't like him. - How could you tell? - Well, I am psychic, you know. - Where is she? - Who? Rogue. She's gone. Welcome, Professor. Welcome to Cerebro. This certainly is a big, round room. The brain waves of mutants are different from average humans. This device amplifies my power, allowing me to locate mutants across great distances. - That's how I intend to find Rogue. - Why don't you just use it to find Magneto? I've been trying, but he's found some way to shield himself from it. How would he know how to do that? Because he helped me build it. Now if you'll excuse me... Have you ever...? Used Cerebro? No. It takes a degree of control and... for someone like me, it's... Dangerous. ...now boarding at track 4. - She's at the station. - Where is it? A few miles west of here. You can't leave the mansion. It's the opportunity Magneto needs. - Listen, I'm the reason she took off. - We had a deal. She's all right. She's just upset. Storm, Cyclops, find her. See if you can talk to her. - What? - Where's my motorcycle? Hey, kid. I'm sorry about last night. Me, too. You running again? I heard the professor was mad at me. - Who told you that? - A boy at school. - When's the last time you saw her? - She was supposed to meet me for lunch. You look around, I'll check with the ticket agent. Welcome, Professor. - You think I should go back. - I think you should follow your instincts. The first boy I ever kissed ended up in a coma for three weeks. I can still feel him inside my head. And it's the same with you. There's not many people that'll understand what you're going through. But I think this guy Xavier's one of them. He seems to genuinely wanna help you. And that's a rare thing. For people like us. OK, so... What do you say? Give these geeks one more shot? Come on, I'll take care of you. - You promise? - Yeah. Yeah, I promise. Come along now. I told you not to... She's about 17, my height, has brown hair and she... Scream for me. Quit playing around. You must be Wolverine. That remarkable metal doesn't run through your entire body, does it? Stop! Stop it! - What the hell do you want with me? - You? My dear boy! Whoever said I wanted you? Young people! All right, hold it! Hold it right there. Stay where you are. Put your hands over your heads. Now! You Homo sapiens and your guns. - That's enough, Eric. - Let them go. Why not come out where I can see you, Charles? What do you want her for? Can't you read my mind? What now? Save the girl? You'll have to kill me, Charles. And what will that accomplish? Let them pass that law and they'll have you in chains with a number on your forehead. - It won't be that way. - Then kill me and find out. No? Then release me. Fine! Care to press your luck, Charles? I don't think I can stop them all. Still unwilling to make sacrifices. That's what makes you weak. Goodbye, Charles. - You said he wanted me. - I made a terrible mistake. His helmet was somehow designed to block my telepathy. Couldn't see what he was after till it was too late. - Where are you going? - To find her. - How? - The traditional way: look. - Logan, you can't do this alone. - Who'll help me? You? - So far, you've all done a bang-up job. - Then help us. Fight with us. Fight with you? Join the team? Be an X-Man? Who the hell do you think you are? You're a mutant. The world is full of people that hate and fear you and you're wasting your time trying to protect them. I got better things to do. You know, Magneto's right. There's a war coming. - Are you sure you're on the right side? - At least I've chosen a side. I'm looking for Dr Jean Grey. Senator Kelly. I'm Professor Charles Xavier. I was afraid if I went to hospital, they would... Treat you like a mutant? We're not what you think. Not all of us. Tell it to the ones who did this to me. Senator... I want you to try and relax. I'm not going to hurt you. Welcome to the future. Brother. The machine emits radiation that triggers mutation in ordinary human beings. But the mutation is unnatural. Kelly's body is rejecting it. - His cells began to break down immediately. - What effect does it have on mutants? There appears to be none. But I fear it will harm any normal person exposed to it. - So what does Magneto want with Rogue? - I don't know. Wait a second. You said this machine draws its power from Magneto. - And that it weakened him. - Yes. In fact, it nearly killed him. He's going to transfer his power to Rogue and use her to power the machine. Is somebody there? Yes. I'm here. Please don't leave me! I don't want to be alone. All right. Do you hate normal people? Sometimes. Why? I suppose... I'm afraid of them. Well... I think you've got one less person... to be afraid of. Cyclops, you and Storm ready the jet. I'm gonna find Rogue. Get Logan a uniform. Wait a minute. He's not coming with us, is he? - Yes. - Sorry, but he'll endanger the mission and... I wasn't the one who gave the station a new sunroof, pal. No, you were the one who stabbed Rogue in the chest. Why don't you take your little mission and stick it up... Senator Kelly is dead. I'm going to find her. Settle this. I'm sorry. You can still hear me... can't you? You've taught me everything in my life that was ever worth knowing. And if anything happens... I'll take care of them. Jean? Jean! No! Jean? Jean. Answer me. Please. I know where Magneto's going. Magnificent, isn't she? - I've seen it. - I first saw her in 1949. America was going to be the land of tolerance. Of peace. Are you going to kill me? Yes. - Why? - Because there is no land of tolerance. There is no peace, not here or anywhere else. Whole families destroyed simply because they were born different from those in power. Well, after tonight, the world's powerful will be just like us. They will return home as brothers. As mutants. Our cause will be theirs. Your sacrifice will mean our survival. I'll understand if that comes as small consolation. Put her in the machine. I'll raise it. Magneto is here - Liberty Island. Presumably his objective is to mutate the world leaders at the summit on Ellis Island. He doesn't know his machine kills, and judging from what the professor saw if Magneto gave Rogue enough power, he could wipe out everyone in New York City. All right. We can insert here at the George Washington Bridge. Come around the bank, just off of Manhattan, land on the far side of Liberty Island. Here. What about harbour patrol? Radar? If they have anything that can pick up our jet, they deserve to catch us. You actually go outside in these things? What would you prefer? Yellow spandex? Whoa. There's the bridge. I'm takin' her down. Storm, some cover, please. Toad, Mystique, stay sharp. We're not alone. And you stay here. Once I've given my power to the girl, I'll be temporarily weakened. You'll be my only defence. Sounds like a storm's comin'. - Sorry. - You call that a landing? The torch. ...the proceedings. The first dignitaries started to arrive about an hour ago, greeted with a garden-party atmosphere designed to entertain them as the others traversed the rigid security. - There's someone here. - Where? - I don't know. Keep your eye open. - Logan... Damn it! - Anything? - There's someone here. I just can't see 'em. Wait! Back up! Back up! Jean! Oh, God! Don't move. Don't you people ever die? Do you know what happens to a toad when it's struck by lightning? The same thing that happens to everything else. Logan, is that you? The other one ain't far away. - Come on. We have to regroup. - I know, but there's a problem. You're not part of the group. Hey, hey! It's me. - Prove it. - You're a dick. OK. Hey! - Everybody get out of here. - What is it? I can't move. Ah, my brothers. Welcome. And you, just point those claws of yours in a safer direction. You better close your eyes. Storm, fry 'em. A bolt of lightning into a huge copper conductor. I thought you lived at a school. For those of you not familiar with the historical significance... Mystique? - Mystique! - I've seen Senator Kelly. So, the good senator survived his fall. And the swim to shore. He's become even more powerful than I imagined. - He's dead. - It's true. I saw him die. Like those people down there will die. Are you sure you saw what you saw? I would also like to thank the President of the United States of America for hosting this event under the lights of the great city of New York. Why do none of you understand what I'm trying to do? Those people down there control our fate and the fate of every other mutant! Well... soon our fate will be theirs. Help! Please help me! You're so full of shit. If you're really so righteous, it'd be you in that thing. Help! Somebody help me! Please! Somebody please help me! Somebody! Help me... Logan! - I'm sorry, my dear. - Don't do this. This is mine. You owe me a scream. Hey, bub, I'm not finished with you yet. - Jean. - Scott, when I tell you, open your eyes. - No! - Trust me. You drop something? Now! - Thanks. - Don't mention it. - Gotta get her outta there. Can you hit it? - The rings are moving too fast. - Shoot it! - I'll kill her! Storm, can you get me up? - I can't control it like that. - Then let me go. If I don't make it, at least you can still blast the damn thing. All right, do it! Jean, use your power. Try to steady him. Hang on to something. Scott, wait! - Jean, I have to! - Just wait! I have a shot. I'm taking it. Come on... Hey, this one's alive. Let's get him outta here. Welcome back. I knew you'd find your way. I had you to guide me. How did we do? Oh, that tickles. Hey. Hey. How are you feeling? Fantastic. That was a brave thing you did. - Did it work? - Yeah. She's fine. She took on a few of your more charming personality traits for a while. But we lived through it. I think she's a little taken with you. Well, you can tell her my heart belongs to someone else. You know, you and I... How's the professor? He's good. Good. There's an abandoned military compound at Alkali Lake in the Canadian Rockies close to where we found you. There's not much left but... you might find some answers. - Thank you. - Are you going to say goodbye to them? The Mutant Registration Act lost its main proponent with the reversal of Senator Robert Kelly who until now had provided the loudest voice in the cry for mutant registration. I was wrong in this particular issue and I hope, in time, I may be forgiven. Thank you. The Mutant Registration Act continues to draw support... Mystique. Son of a bitch. ...from many parents' rights groups who feel threatened by unidentified mutants. In a related story, the body of Senator Kelly's aide, Henry Guyrich, was found today. Preliminary coroner's reports seem to indicate that Guyrich was mauled by a bear. Hey! - You running again? - Not really. I have some things to take care of up north. I kinda like it. I don't want you to go. I'll be back for this. Doesn't it ever wake you in the night, the feeling that someday they will pass that foolish law, or one just like it, and come for you? And your children? It does indeed. What do you do when you wake up to that? I feel a swell of pity for the poor soul who comes to that school looking for trouble. Why do you come here, Charles? Why do you ask questions to which you already know the answers? Oh, yes. Your continuing search for hope. You know this plastic prison of theirs won't hold me for ever. The war is still coming, Charles, and I intend to fight it. By any means necessary. And I will always be there. Old friend.", "url": "https://subslikescript.com/movie/X-Men-120903"},

One day, a mutant by the name of Nightcrawler infiltrates the White House and attempts to assassinate the president, setting off a chain reaction of anti-mutant measures by the government. Meanwhile, Logan is trying to discover his past. As scientist named William Stryker discovers Professor X's secret school and Cerebro, Magneto's partner, Mystique, is planning to break her leader out of prison. But when Professor X's school is attacked by Stryker's forces, Logan, Rogue, Iceman and a few are lucky to escape. Those who remain meet in Boston, where they form an uneasy alliance with Magneto to stop Stryker and rescue Professor X.", "transcript": "foodval.com - stop by if you're interested in the nutritional composition of food   ---  \n        Encoded by Judas Enjoy! Mutants. Since the discovery oftheir existence... they have been regarded with fear... suspicion, often hatred. Across the planet, debate rages. Are mutants the next link in the evolutionary chain... or simply a new species of humanity... fighting for their share ofthe world? Eitherway, it is an historical fact: Sharing the world has never been humanity's defining attribute. \"We are not enemies, but friends. \n \n \n \n    (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n \n \"We must not be enemies. \"Though passion may have strained... it must not break the bonds ofour affection.\" Lincoln said that in his first inaugural address as our nation's 1 6th president. It's one ofmy favorites. So, ifyou'll please have your tickets ready... we can begin the tour. Jackie, could you clear my schedule this evening? I wanna have dinner with my son. Yes, Mr. President. Excuse me, sir. Are you lost? Perimeter breach at visitor's checkpoint. Multiple subjects. Mr. President, security breach. Jackie, leave. Let's get him out to the car. Exit's not clear. We don't know how many there are. \n \n \n \n    (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n \n Post five. Secure. - There's something in the corridor. - To the shelter. Negative! Not clear! - It's outside the oval office. - Lock this place down! - Don't shoot! - There! My God. Neanderthals. We once believed that they were wiped out... by years of conflict with a much more advanced branch of humanity... called Cro-Magnon man. But recent research into our own DNA... suggests that these two species may have interbred... evolving into modern humans. In otherwords, into what? Us. Us. Right. Artie, not here. Come on. Pay attention. Makes me insane when she does this. What are you looking at, you sick― Busted my lip. - I have cancer. - To the shelter! - No! - Hi. They're gonna kill— What's wrong with this? It doesn't work. Jean? You okay? Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. It'sjust, uh— just a headache. It's notjust a headache, is it? Listen, I— I wasn't really sure how to say this... but ever since Liberty Island, you've been— Scott. You've been different. My telepathy's been off lately. I can't seem to focus. I can hear everything. It's notjust your telepathy. A month ago, you had to concentrate just to levitate a book or a chair across the room. Now, when you have a nightmare, the entire bedroom shakes. My dreams are getting worse. Scott. I keep feeling something terrible is about to happen. I would never let anything happen to you. Hey. Have you guys seen Bobby and Rogue? Something's happening in the food court. My brother asked you a simple question. Why are you being such a dick? Yeah, why are you being such a dick? Because I can. Can I have a light? Hmm. - Sorry. I can't help you out, pal. - John, knock it off. Why don't you stop showing off? For her? I can't help it ifyour girlfriend's getting excited. - I don't think she's getting excited. - Trying to have a good time. I thinkyou're the only one having a good time. Hey! That's real cute, man. What are you gonna do? Suddenly, you're not so tough. Hello? Honey, can you hear me? Bobby, what did you do? I didn't do this. No. I did. And the next time you feel like showing off, don't. Breaking news. We're coming to you live from Washington... where there's been an attack in the Oval Office ofthe White House. Details are still coming in, but we have been informed... that the president and vice-president were not harmed. Sources say the attack involved one or more mutants. l think it's time to leave, Professor. Authorities have closed off― I think you're right. Yearrgh! Unh! My opinion? Magneto's behind this. No. I don't think so, Scott. While Eric is capable oforganizing something like this from prison... for him it would be irrational. It would only hurt his goal of mutant prosperity. You mean superiority. You're right. - If Eric had his way― - Ofcourse, you know how the government will respond. They'll reintroduce the Registration Act. Or worse. The president could declare a state ofemergency. Place every mutant in the country under arrest. Do you think the assassin was working alone? Well, we'll only know that ifwe find him before the authorities do. I've been trying to track him using Cerebro... but his movements are inexplicably erratic. When I have more exact coordinates... Storm,Jean, I'll need you to take thejet and try and pick him up. It was close, wasn't it? Closer than anyone's admitted. What do you need, William? Just your authorization... for a special operation. Uh, no, thank you, Mr. President. And somehow I thought you were here to talk about school reform. Funny you should say that, Mr. President. Senator. Mr. President. - Thankyou for having me. - Senator Kelly, this is Colonel William Stryker. - How do you do? - His department has been dealing with the mutant phenomenon... since before my time. As I recall, you were a staunch supporter of the Registration Act, Senator. It seems your ideas on the mutant problem have changed recently. For the best, I hope. So, what are you proposing, Mr. Stryker? Uh, may I, Mr. President? We've managed to gather evidence of a mutant training facility... in the Salem region of upstate New York. Where did you get this information? Interrogation ofone of the mutant terrorists... from the Liberty Island incident. Eric? Eric Lehnsherr? You have access to him? Magneto. Yes. We developed the technology that built his plastic prison. - This facility is a school. - Sure it is. What the hell is that? Ajet. - What kind ofjet? - We don't know... but it comes up out ofthe basketball court. If we'd been allowed to do ourjobs, Mr. President, before this incident― All right. Listen. William, you enter, you detain, you question... but the last thing we need to see... is the body ofa mutant kid on the 6:00 news. Mr. Stryker. Senator Kelly. This is Yuriko, my personal assistant. Quite a handshake. What can I do foryou? Uh, Eric Lehnsherr's prison. I'd like to arrange a visit if possible. It isn't a petting zoo, Senator. In this conflict, he is the enemy. You'rejust a spectator. So why don't you sit this one out, all right? Conflict? Mr. Stryker, do you really want to turn this into some kind ofwar? I was piloting black-ops missions in thejungles of North Vietnam... while you were sucking on your mama's tit at Woodstock, Kelly. Don't lecture me about war. This already is a war. You're dead. You're so dead. You're dead. I— I don't wanna hurt you. I'm not afraid. Hey. Logan! It's Logan. You miss me, kid? Not really. Mm. How you doing? I'm okay. How are you? Who's this? Oh, this is Bobby. He's my— I'm her boyfriend. Call me Iceman. Right. Boyfriend? So how do you guys― Well, we're still working on that. Look who's come back. Just in time. For what? We need a baby-sitter. Baby-sitter? Nice to see you again, Logan. - Hi, Logan. - Hi,Jean. Uh, I should go and get thejet ready. Yeah, well, it was good to meet you. Come on. Let's go. Bye, Logan. - I'll see you later. - Okay. Storm and I are heading to Boston. We won't be gone long. The professor wants us to track down a mutant who attacked the president. So it was a mutant? You'll be here when we get back― unless you plan on running offagain. Well, I can probably think of a few reasons to stick around. Find what you were looking for, Logan? More or less. I'll see you boys later. - Be safe, okay? - You too. - Bye. - See ya. Aren't you gonna welcome me home? Your bike needs gas. Then fill her up. Mr. Laurio. How long can we keep this up? How long is your sentence? Forever. Not necessarily forever, Mr. Lehnsherr. Just until I've got all that I need. Mr. Stryker. How kind ofyou to visit. Have you come back to make sure the tax-payers' dollars are keeping me comfortable? Done. You can go. Now... Mr. Lehnsherr... I'd like to have one final talk... about the house that Xavier built... and the machine called Cerebro. Logan, my tolerance foryour smoking in the mansion notwithstanding... continue smoking that in here and you'll spend the rest ofyour days... under the beliefthat you're a six-year-old girl. - You'd do that? - I'd haveJean braid your hair. Welcome back. Ooh. You want me to leave? No.Just don't move. These lights represent every living person on the planet. White lights are humans. And these are the mutants. Through Cerebro, I'm connected to them. And they to me. You see, Logan... We're not as alone as you think. I found the base at Alkali Lake. There was nothing there. The broken line represents the path ofthe mutant who attacked the president. I've been finding it difficult to get a lock on him. Well, can't you just concentrate harder? If I wanted to kill him, yes. There. Looks like he's finally stopped running. I need you to read my mind again. Logan... I'm afraid the results will be the same as before. - We had a deal. - The mind is not a box that can be simply unlocked and opened. - It's a beehive with a million different compartments. - Spare me the lecture. I have no doubt that your amnesia, your adamantium skeleton, the claws... are all somehow connected. But, Logan... sometimes the mind needs to discover things for itself. I promise you we'll talk again when I return. Oh. Ifyou will be kind enough to watch over the children tonight... Scott and I are going to visit an old friend. l'm sending coordinates of where the mutant seems to have settled for now. Soon as you find him, bring him back to the mansion. Let's hope he cooperates. Yes. For his sake. Good luck. Stryker, William. What are you doing in here? Estoy tirando la basura. Garbage. These are the coordinates. He's a teleporter. Must be why the professor had trouble locking onto him. We're not here to hurt you! We just wanna talk! - Are you bored yet? - Oh, yeah. Sure you don't wanna come down? - You have him? - He's not going anywhere. Are you? Please don't kill me. I didn't mean to harm anyone. Now why would people have gotten that impression? What's your name? Wagner. Kurt Wagner. There was so much shooting... such fear... and then there was only pain. I could see it all happening... but I couldn't stop myself. It was like a bad dream. Perhaps He is testing me. And before you were in the White House... what do you remember? Nothing. I was here. Jean. I'd rather get him back to the professor. The professor? Did you do these yourself? Yes. And what about this? I need you to read my mind again. I'm afraid the results will be the same as before. He'll be indestructible. His entire skeleton— Adamantium. Sometimes the mind needs to discover things for itself. Wolverine. No memory. He'll have no memory. A dozen tourists in the White House during the attack... are still being held for questioning. Best tasting food. A machine that's so darn easy— ...president will address the nation— For the White House assassin, following hundreds of― Can't sleep? - How can you tell? - 'Cause you're awake. Right. How about you? I don't sleep. Hey. Doesn't anybody sleep around here? Apparently not. Got any beer? This is a school. So that's a \"no\"? Yeah, that's a \"no.\" Got anything other than chocolate milk? There should be some soda in that small cupboard. Thanks. No problem. I'll take him from here. It's all right, Scott. Nice shades. Thanks. Charles Xavier. Have you come to rescue me? Sorry, Eric. Not today. To what do I owe the pleasure? The assassination attempt on the president― What do you know about it? Nothing. Only what I read in the papers. You really shouldn't have to ask, Charles. What's happened to you? I've had frequent visits from William Stryker. You remember him, don't you? William Stryker. His son,Jason, was once a student ofyours, wasn't he? Yes. Years ago. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to help him... at least not in the way that his father wanted. And nowyou think that taking in the Wolverine... will make up foryour failure with Stryker's son. How long you been here? Couple years. And your parentsjust sent you off to mutant school? Actually, my parents think this is a prep school. Oh, I see. I suppose lots of prep schools have their own dorms, campuses— Jets. So you and Rogue, huh? Yeah. It's not what you think. I'd like it to be, but it'sjust— It'sjust that it's not easy... when you wanna be closer to someone... but you can't. You know, I've seen how you look at Dr. Grey. Excuse me? Nothing. You haven't told him about his past, have you? I've put him on the path. Logan's mind is still fragile. Is it? Or are you afraid of losing one ofyour precious X-Men... old friend? Eric, what have you done? I'm sorry, Charles. I couldn't help it. What have you told Stryker? Everything. The war has begun. Scott! You should've killed me when you had the chance! But now and then... every mother needs to get away. Without her, the babies are helpless. Sensing danger, the mother rat races home. The babies can't even see the killer. And someone uninvited is coming to dinner. She arrives too late for one baby. The centipede was deadly. Hi. - What is it? - Shh, shh. You picked the wrong house, bub. You all right? Stay here. Come on! Run! Move, move, move! This way. Let's go. Come on! Go, go, go! Run! Run! John! Hey. Where's Rogue? I don't know. l gotta find her. Hey! Come on! Here. Take her. Hurry! Go on. Get in. Let's go. Let's go. Come on. Let's go! Come on! Hey. Take him. He's stunned. I can help you. Help them. Rogue! Bobby! This way. Come on. Everybody, follow me up here. Move! Move! Go! Go! Come on. Let's go. Come on. This way. This is it. Logan! You wanna shoot me? Shoot me! Don't shoot him! Not yet. Wolverine? Well, I must admit, this is certainly the last place... I'd expect to find you. How long has it been? Fifteen years? You haven't changed one bit. Me, on the other hand— Nature. Wait! Wait! You guys, we gotta do something. They're gonna kill him. - He can handle himself. Let's go. - Bobby! Please. I didn't realize Xavier was taking in animals— even animals as unique as you. Who are you? Don't you remember? No! No! Logan, come on. Let's go. Logan. Go! I'll be fine. But we won't. Go. Keep going. All right. Get in. Get in! I'm driving. Hey. Maybe next time. This is Cyclops's car. Oh, yeah? What the hell was that back there? Stryker. His name is Stryker. Who is he? I can't remember. Zone one clear. Roger that. Here. This is yours. l don't like uncomfortable silences. What are you doing? I don't think that's the CD player. Whoa. Sit back. - Where we going? - Storm and Jean are in Boston. We'll head that way. - My parents live in Boston. - Good. Sergeant? Most ofthe mutants escaped through a series oftunnels that weren't in our schematics. We have several in custody. How many? Six, sir. Welcome, Professor. Take what we need, gentlemen. Look, I just think all this anti-mutant protesting... underscores the genuine growing concern among most Americans. I think mutant registration— But why stop there? Maybe it would be easier to round up mutants by the truckload. Or maybe you'd like all-out war, Mr. Shaw. Oh, please. Turn that shit off, Lou. Lot on your mind? Mr. Laurio? I'm Grace. You want another beer? Of course you do. You're really aggressive. Yes, I am. Oh, l— I've never hooked up with a girl like you before. I know. It's, uh, kinda dirty in here, don't you think? That's the idea. Velcro. Nice. Bottom's up. I certainly hope so. Bottom's up. - William. - Please, Xavier, don't get up. I call it the neural inhibitor. It keeps you outta here. What have you done with Scott? Don't worry. I'm just giving him a little reeducation. Ofcourse, you know all about that, don't you? William, you wanted me to cure your son. But mutation is not a disease. You're lying! You were more frightened of him than I was. You know, just one year afterJason returned from your school... my wife— You see he resented us. He blamed us for his condition. So he would toy with our minds... projecting visions and scenarios into our brains. Well, my wife, in the end— She took a power drill to her left temple... in an attempt to bore the images out. My boy, the great illusionist. For someone who hates mutants... you certainly keep some strange company. Oh, they serve their purpose... as long as they can be controlled. You arranged the attack on the president. You didn't even have to read my mind. You know, I've been working with mutants as long as you have, Xavier... but the most frustrating thing I've learned... is that nobody really knows how many even exist... or how to find them— except you. Unfortunately, this little potion won't work on you, will it? You're much too powerful for that. Instead, we'll go right to the source. Allow me to introduce mutant 1 43. The fluid secreted by his brain acts as a mind-controlling agent. But that's only where it begins. Jason. Oh, my God, William. This is your son. What have you done to him? No, Charles! My son is dead... just like the rest ofyou. Mom? Dad? Ronny? Is anybody home? I'll try and find us some clothes. Don't burn anything. Hey. I found some of my mom's old clothes. I think they're from before I was born. Groovy. Hello. Come on,Jean. Where are you? These are my grandmother's. Thanks. You won't hurt me. Wow. I'm— l'm sorry. It's okay. Mmm. Hey, Ronny. Next time you— Who the hell are you? Uh— Bobby. Honey, aren't you supposed to be at school? - Bobby, who is this guy? - Uh, this is Professor Logan. There's something I need to tell you. You're clear. Have a nice sleep, Lehnsherr? There's something different about you, Mr. Laurio. Yeah. I was having a good day. No. No, it's not that. - Sit down. - No. Sit your ass down. What could it be? What are you doing? Ahh. There it is. Too much iron in your blood. Mr. Laurio, never trust a beautiful woman... especially one who's interested in you. So, uh... when did you first know you were a— A― A mutant? Would you cut that out? You have to understand, we thought Bobby was going to a school for the gifted. - Bobby is gifted. - We know that. Wejust didn't realize he was― We still love you, Bobby. It'sjust this mutant problem is a little— - What mutant problem? - Complicated. What exactly are you a professor of, Mr. Logan? Art. Well, you should see what Bobby can do. Bobby. I can do a lot more than that. Oh. Ronny! This is all my fault. Actually... they discovered that males are the ones who carry the mutant gene and pass it on... so it's his fault. ...the assassination attempt... 911. Please state your emergency. I need the police. There are people in our house. They won't let us leave. Authorities refused to comment... but it's believed that a manhunt for several fugitives from the facility... is now underway. Nobody's responding. I can't get a signal. Why don't you take a break? I'll keep trying. Right. So, what are they? They are angelic symbols... passed on to mankind by the Archangel Gabriel. They're beautiful. How many do you have? One for every sin... so quite a few. You and Miss Grey are schoolteachers? Yes. At a school for people like us... where we can be safe. Safe from what? Everyone else. You know, outside ofthe circus, most people were afraid of me. But I didn't hate them. I pitied them. Do you know why? Because most people will never know anything... beyond what they see with their own two eyes. Well, I gave up on pity a long time ago. Someone so beautiful should not be so angry. Sometimes anger... can help you survive. So can faith. Storm, l found an active com device. Where? Oh, it's for me. Bobby... have you tried not being a mutant? No one's left,Jean. Soldiers came. What about the children? Some ofthem escaped. I'm not sure about the rest. We haven't been able to reach the professor or Scott either. Where are you, Logan? Boston, with Bobby Drake's family. - Okay. We're on ourway. - And Storm? Make it fast. We have to go now. Why? Now! Logan, what's wrong? Drop the knives and put your hands in the air. - What's going on here? - Ronny. I said drop the knives. Open the door! Break it. Turn around. - Up against the wall. - Okay! This isjust a misunderstanding. Put the knives down. I can't. Look. Oh! All right, the rest ofyou, on the ground now. Look, kid, l said on the ground. We don't want to hurt you, kid. You know all those dangerous mutants you hear about on the news? I'm the worst one. Look out! Guten tag. Who the hell is this? Kurt Wagner. But in the Munich circus, I was known as \"the Incredible Nightcrawler\"— - Aw, save it. Storm? - We're outta here. Whoa. Jason, stop it! It's all right. You can come out. Have they gone? Yes. - Where are all the other students? - I don't know. Well, then, we'll have to find them, won't we? We'll use Cerebro. Come on. How far are we? We're actually coming up on the mansion now. I've got two signals approaching. Coming in fast. Unidentified aircraft, you are ordered to descend to 20,000 feet. Return with our escort to Hanscom Air Force base. You have 1 0 seconds to comply. - Wow. Somebody's angry. - I wonderwhy. We are coming up alongside you to escort you to Hanscom Air Force base. Loweryour altitude now. Repeat, loweryour altitude to 20,000 feet. This is your last warning. They're falling back. They're marking us. - What? - They're gonna fire. Hang on! I gotta shake 'em. - Please don't do that again. - I agree. Don't we have any weapons in this heap? Warning, warning, warning. Warning, warning, warning, warning, warning. Warning, warning, warning, warning, warning, warning. Warning, warning, warning— - Everybody okay back there? - No. Oh, my God. There's two of'em. There's one more. Jean— Oh, God! Rogue! No! - Jean? - It's not me. When will these people learn how to fly? Thank you. Bitte schön. - Can you hear what they're saying? - I could take a closer look. His name is Colonel William Stryker... and he invaded your mansion for one purpose: he wanted Cerebro. Or enough of it to build one of his own. But that doesn't make any sense. Strykerwould need the professor to operate it. Which I think is the only reason my old friend is still alive. Oh, my God. Now, what are you all so afraid of? While Cerebro is working, Charles' mind is connected... to every living person on the planet. If he were forced to concentrate hard enough on a particular group― let's say, mutants, for example— - he could kill us all. - Wait a minute. How would Stryker even know where to find Cerebro in the first place? Because I told him. I helped Charles build it, remember? Mr. Stryker has powerful methods of persuasion. Even against a mutant as strong as Charles. So who's this Stryker anyway? He's a military scientist. He spent his whole life trying to solve the mutant problem. Ifyou want a more intimate perspective, why don't you ask Wolverine? You don't remember, do you? William Stryker, the only other man I know who can manipulate adamantium. The metal on your bones. It carries his signature. - But the professor— - The professor trusted... you were smart enough to discover this on your own. He gives you more credit than I do. - Why do you need us? - Mystique has discovered plans ofa base... that Stryker's been operating out offor decades. We know that's where he's building the second Cerebro... but we don't know where this base is... and I believe one ofyou might. - The professor already tried. - Once again, you think it's all about you. Oh... hello. I didn't mean to snoop. Just try and relax. I'm sorry. Stryker's at Alkali Lake. That's where the professor sent me. There's nothing left. There's nothing left on the surface, Logan. The base is underground. Hey. Hey. You okay? Yeah. You sure? How we doing? Not good. It'll take four or five hours before I can get it offthe ground. That's not what I meant. I'm just worried about Scott. I'm worried about you. That was some display of power up there. Obviously, it wasn't enough. Hey, hey. Come on. All right? I love him. Do you? Girls flirt with the dangerous guy, Logan... they don't take him home. They marry the good guy. I could be the good guy. Logan, the good guy sticks around. Jean. Please. Please. Don't make me do this. Do what? This. Excuse me. They say you can imitate anybody... even theirvoice. Even their voice. Then why not stay in disguise all the time? You know, look like everyone else. Because we shouldn't have to. Look― No one's ever left a scar quite like you. What do you want, an apology? You know what I want. But what do you want? What do you really want? I want you to get out. Jesus. Why don't we get uniforms? Yeah, where's ours? They're on order. Should arrive in a few years. We love what you've done with your hair. Hey, hey. Come on. Let's go. So, they say you're the bad guy. Is that what they say? That's a dorky-looking helmet. What's it for? This dorky-looking helmet is the only thing that's gonna protect me... from the real bad guys. - What's your name? -John. What's your real name, John? Pyro. Quite a talent you have there, Pyro. I can only manipulate the fire. I can't create it. You are a god among insects. Never let anyone tell you different. Sir, the machine has been completed to all specifications. Good. Ow! If I may ask, sir, why are we keeping the children here? I'm a scientist, Sergeant Lyman. When l build a machine, I wanna make sure that it's working. All right, this is a topographic map ofthe dam. This is the spillway. You see these density changes in the terrain? They're tire tracks. That's the entrance. Mm-hmm. And this shows the depth ofthe ice that's covering the ground. Now, this is recent water activity. Ifwe go in there, Stryker could flood the spillway. Can you teleport inside? No. I have to be able to see where I'm going... otherwise I could wind up inside a wall. I'll go. I have a hunch he'll want me alive. Wolverine, whoever goes into the dam needs to be able to operate the spillway mechanism. What do you intend to do? Scratch it with your claws? I'll take my chances. But I won't. Sir, there's someone coming down the spillway. I'm flooding it. Wait. Stryker! Stryker! Well, look who's come home. Move and you're dead. The one thing I know better than anyone is my own work. Seal the room. Shoot it. Seal the room Step away! We have a metamorph loose. Could be anybody. Anybody? What— Can you override the spillway mechanism? Everything's controlled from inside that room. That's why the doors are so thick. Oh, really? Get some charges! Blow the doors open! Take out these cameras! I'm in. She's good. You have no idea. Fire in the hole. Move, move, move. Sergeant, she's opened the spillway doors. More mutants have entered the base. How many? We've lost coms. There's some sort of electrical interference― Sergeant Lyman, gather the rest ofyour men and meet me outside Cerebro. You carry on. When l come back, I want this door open all the way! Welcome, Professor. - Don't leave me alone, please? - You can come inside. Have you found it? A large portion ofenergy from the dam has been diverted to this chamber. Cerebro. There it is. Can you shut it down from here? No. Come. There's little time. Not without us. Oh, my God. The children. - Kurt, will you come with me? - Yes. Where are they? They're being held in a containment cell one level down. Stryker. All right... we'll get the children and meet you at Cerebro. Okay. I'll try to find Scott and the professor. - Will you be all right without us? - Yeah. I'll be fine. Where's Logan? He's gone. You, set up a perimeter. Move, move. Jason. It's time. Time to find our friends. Is it time to find our friends? - All ofthem. - All ofthem? - All ofthe mutants. - All the mutants? - Everywhere. - Everywhere? That's right. Every one ofthem? Oh, yes. Good. It's time to bring it to an end. Make me proud. Just don't move. Kill anyone who approaches... even if it's me. Go! l'll take care of him! This is one lover's quarrel we cannot get involved in, my dear. Scott! Scott? - Help us! Anybody! - Listen. Help! Get us out of here. - Julie? - Storm. Get us out of here! Okay, we're coming. Scott! Scott, don't do this! Jean, no, no, no. It's okay. It's okay. It's me. Scott. I'm so sorry. I thought I'd lost you. Oh, God. I'm so sorry. I could see you, but I couldn't stop myself. I tried. I'm sorry. I love you so much. I love you. My leg. Okay, easy. Easy. Scott... something's wrong. My God. No! Have you found the mutants yet? Have you found all ofthem? I'm trying. There are so many ofthem. Then concentrate. Concentrate. The tricky thing about adamantium is... that ifyou ever manage to process... its raw, liquid form, you gotta keep it that way. Keep it hot. Because once the metal cools, it's indestructible. But you already know that. I used to thinkyou were one ofa kind, Wolverine. I was wrong. Holy shit. That's it. Whoa. Where do you thinkyou're going? I'm sick ofthis kid's table shit. I'm going in there. John, they told us to stay here. You always do as you're told? Find all the mutants. Find them. Find all the mutants. Find them all. Each one. All ofthem. Good. Kill them. Concentrate. Concentrate harder. Now, find them all. Find all the mutants. You, concentrate harder. Kill them. Kill them all. Kill them. Cerebro. We're too late. Eric, hurry! That's strange. How does it look from there, Charles? Still fighting the good fight? From here, it doesn't look like they're playing byyour rules. Maybe it's time to play by theirs. There's been a change of plan. Good-bye, Charles. There's been a change of plans. Now find them. Find them all— the humans. Find all the humans. Every one. How does it feel, bub? Why did you come back? You cut me open. You took my life! You make it sound as if I stole something from you. As I recall, it was you who volunteered for the procedure. Who am I? You... arejust a failed experiment. If you really knew about your past... what kind of person you were... the work we did together― People don't change, Wolverine. You were an animal then. You're an animal now. I just gave you claws. What the hell is that? What is it? The dam's ruptured. It's gonna flood water into the spillway. It's trying to relieve the pressure. It's too late. In a few minutes, we'll all be underwater. Come with me, and I'll tell you everything you want to know. You can't help your friends. They're as good as dead, Wolverine. You're a survivor, always have been. Oh, l thought I wasjust an animal... with claws. If we die, you die. Aaah! There are no answers that way, Wolverine! Find all the humans. Every one. Find them. Find all the humans. Find them all. - What is this? - Cerebro. Storm. Jean. Are you okay? Yeah. I'm fine. What's happening? Professor's still in there... with another mutant. He's trapped in some kind of illusion. Oh, my God. Magneto's reversed Cerebro. It's not targeting mutants anymore. - Who is it targeting? - Everyone else. Impossible. - Everybody stand back. - Scott, no. His mind is connected to Cerebro. Opening the door could kill him and everyone his mind is linked to. Wait. Kurt, I need you to take me inside. - Storm, who is this guy? Who are you? - My name is Kurt Wagner... but in the Munich circus― He's a teleporter. I told you, if I can't see where I'm going— I have faith in you. Don't believe anything you see in there. Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on Earth— as it is in heaven. Hello. What are you looking for? Professor, can you hear me? - You've got to stop Cerebro now. - Who are you talking to? No. Don't move. But she'sjust a little girl. No, she's not. I've got my eyes on you. Mr. Stryker. Funny, we keep running into each other. Mark my words, it'll never happen again. Kurt, it's about to get very cold in here. I'm not going anywhere. What are you doing? Find all the humans. Kill them. Every single one. Find all the humans. Focus. Focus. Find all the humans. Stop it! Jason. He's going to be so angry at me. Logan. Logan, where are you? We have to get out through the spillway. You don't want to go that way. Trust me. Come on. There's another way out of here. The helicopter was right here! I will take him. Okay. It's okay, Rogue. It's okay. You can let go, honey. - Let go. - Go. I'll be fine. You sure? Yeah. Who has the answers, Wolverine? Those people? That creature in your arms? Huh? Huh? I'll take my chances with him. One day, someone will finish what I've started, Wolverine! One day! Scott, we've got to get to Washington. I fear this has gone beyond Alkali Lake. Bobby. I got 'im. You okay? I am now. - What's wrong? - Vertical thrusters are off line. So fix 'em. I'm trying. - Has anyone seen John? - Pyro? Where the hell is he? He's with Magneto. They're functioning, but I don't know how long they're going to last. I'm trying to override. It's not responding. - Come on! - Oh, no, we've lost the power. There's power in the fuel cells, we'rejust not connecting. Okay. l've― Scott, the engine control system is shot. - Which part? - All of it. - Where's the override? - It's gonna take some time. Storm, we need some kind ofexternal power. - Jean? - Wait. Where isJean? She's outside. No, we're not leaving! Lower the ramp! Storm, lower it! I can't. She's controlling the jet. You, get her, now! She's not letting me. Damn it! I know what I'm doing. - This is— - ...the only way. Jean, listen to me. Don't do this. Good-bye. - Oh, no! No! - No! No! She's gone. - She's gone. - Don't you say that! We gotta go back. She's gone. No! No. She's gone. She's gone. She's― She's gone. The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures. Yea, though I walk through the valley ofthe shadow ofthe death... I will fear no evil... for thou art with me. Today I've been given an opportunity to shed light on recent occurrences... from the attack that ended in this office— Good morning. Good morning— to the unexplained phenomenon that swept the Earth... nearly annihilating our way of life. Good morning, Mr. President. Good morning. Do we like this word \"annihilating\"? Good morning. Good morning, Mr. President. Thankyou. Mr. President, we're live in five, four, three, two― My fellow Americans, in this time ofadversity... we are being offered a moment... a moment to recognize a growing threat within our own population... and take a unique role in the shape of human events. Did wejust lose the feed? Are we still live? Good morning, Mr. President. Please, don't be alarmed. We're not going to harm anyone. - Who are you people? - We're mutants. My name is Charles Xavier. Please, sit down. - I'd rather stand. - Rogue. These files were taken from the private offices ofWilliam Stryker. How did you get this? Well, let'sjust say I know a little girl who can walk through walls. I've never seen this information. I know. Then you also know I don't respond well to threats. Mr. President, this is not a threat. This is an opportunity. There are forces in this world, both mutant and human alike... who believe that a war is coming. You will see from those files that some have already tried to start one... and there have been casualties. Losses on both sides. Mr. President... what you were about to tell the world is true— this is a moment. A moment to repeat the mistakes ofthe past... or to work together for a better future. We're here to stay, Mr. President. The next move is yours. We'll be watching. Mr. President. You know... even when Jean was a student... she was always hesitant about her powers. Always looking to others. Feeling that in some way she was left behind. Do you think― Could we have done more to save her? In the past, she may have let us. There had to be another way. Why did she leave the plane? Because she made a choice. Yes, come on in. Hey, hey. Listen, she did make a choice. It was you. Professor? Is everything all right? Yes, I think it will be. Now, tell me, have any ofyou read a book... by an English novelist named T.H. White... called The Once and Future King? No? Well— Mutation. lt is the key to our evolution. It is how we have evolved from a single-celled organism... into the dominant species on the planet. This process is slow... normally taking thousands and thousands ofyears. But every few hundred millennia... evolution leaps forward.", "url": "https://subslikescript.com/movie/X-Men_2-290334"},
{"title": "X-Men: First Class (2011) - full transcript", "plot": "Before Charles Xavier and Erik Lensherr took the names Professor X and Magneto, they were two young men discovering their powers for the first time. Before they were archenemies, they were closest of friends, working together, with other Mutants (some familiar, some new), to stop the greatest threat the world has ever known. In the process, a rift between them opened, which began the eternal war between Magneto's Brotherhood and Professor X's X-MEN.", "transcript": "foodval.com - stop by if you're interested in the nutritional composition of food   ---  \n        Mama! Mama! Mama! Mother. What are you... I thought you were a burglar. I didn't mean to scare you, darling. I was just getting a snack. Go back to bed. What's the matter? Go on, back to bed. I'll make you a hot chocolate. \n \n \n \n    (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n \n Who are you? And what have you done with my mother? My mother has never set foot in this kitchen in her life. And she certainly never made me a hot chocolate. Unless you count ordering the maid to do it. You're not scared of me? I always believed I couldn't be the only one in the world. The only person who was different. And here you are. Charles Xavier. Raven. You're hungry and alone. Take whatever you want. \n \n \n \n    (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n \n We've got lots of food. You don't have to steal. In fact, you never have to steal again. Understand this, Erik... These Nazis, I'm not like them. Genes are the key, yes? But their goals? Blue eyes? Blond hair? Pathetic. Mmm! Eat the chocolate. It's good. Want some? I want to see my mama. Genes are the key that unlocks the door to a new age, Erik. A new future for mankind. Evolution. You know what I'm talking about? It's a simple thing I ask of you. A little coin is nothing compared to a big gate. Is it? Ja. I tried, herr doctor. I can't... I don't... It's impossible. The one thing I can say for the Nazis is their methods seem to produce results. I'm sorry, Erik. Mama! My darling. How are you? Here's what we're going to do. I'm going to count to three... And you're going to move the coin. You don't move the coin, I pull the trigger. Understand? One. Mama. You can do it. Two. Everything is all right. Three. Yes. Wonderful. Excellent. Nein! Outstanding, Erik. So we unlock your gift with anger. Anger and pain. You and me... We're going to have a lot of fun together. Heterochromia. A gentleman would at least offer to buy me a drink first. Norman, a pint of bitter for me and a Brandy for the lady, please. How did you know that? Lucky guess. My name is Xavier. Charles Xavier. How do you do? Amy. Heterochromia was in reference to your eyes, which I have to say are stunning. One green, one blue. It's a mutation. It's a very groovy mutation. I've got news for you, Amy. You are a mutant. First you proposition a girl, and then you call her deformed. How is that seduction technique working for you? I'll tell you in the morning. No, seriously, though, you mustn't knock it. Mutation took us from single-celled organisms to being the dominant form of reproductive life on this planet. Infinite forms of variation with each generation, all through mutation. Then let's reclaim that word. Mutant and proud. Chin-chin. Hey. I guess I have to buy my own drink. I'm sorry. One cola. Charles here was just telling me that I'm like one of the first sea creatures that grew legs. A tiny bit sexier. I'm sorry. This is my sister, raven. Hi. Amy. And what do you study? Waitressing. Ah. Oh, look, you have heterochromia, too. Sorry, what? Look at her eye. Right. Raven, get your coat, please. Don't talk to me. You did that on purpose. I did not! Why would I do it on purpose? Yes, you did! You know I can't control it sometimes if I'm stressed or tired. You seem to be doing a perfectly good job right now. \"Mutant and proud.\" What? Or is it only with pretty mutations, or invisible ones like yours? But if you're a freak, you better hide. You're being ridiculous. I don't mean to sound like an old fart. Which you are. Sometimes. But we've talked about this, raven. A small slip-up is one thing. A big one does not bear thinking about. \"Mutant and proud.\" \"Mutant and proud\"? If only. Would you date me? Of course I would. Any young man would be lucky to have you. You are stunning. Looking like this? Like... what? Blue? You're my oldest friend. I'm your only friend. Thank you for that. Well? I'm incapable of thinking of you that way. I feel responsible for you. Anything else would just feel wrong. But what if you didn't know me? Unfortunately, I do know you. I don't know what's gotten into you lately. You're awfully concerned with your looks. I'm sleepy. Will you read to me? I can't. I have my thesis coming up. I have to study. Fine, read that. Your thesis always sends me right off. \"To homo neanderthalensis, his mutant cousin, homo sapiens,\" \"was an aberration.\" \"Peaceful cohabitation, if ever it existed, was short-lived.\" \"Records show, without exception,\" \"that the arrival of the mutated human species in any region\" \"was followed by the immediate extinction\" \"of their less-evolved kin.\" Possession of that gold is illegal. I should inform the police. Let's not play this game. Where did you get it? A friend. He recommended your bank most highly. I see. Do you know our terms, sir? Yes. And you should know mine. This gold is what remains of my people. Melted from their possessions. Torn from their teeth. This is blood money. And you're going to help me find the bastards responsible for it. Don't touch that alarm. I want schmidt. Klaus schmidt. Where is he? Our clients don't provide addresses. We're not... Not that sort of bank? Metal fillings, eh? Not gold. Worried someone might steal them? Argentina! Schmidt is in Argentina! Villa gesell! Please! Thank you. I would love to kill you. So mark my words. If you warn anyone I'm coming... I will find you. Another day at the office. Is that colonel hendry? The NATO guy? Yeah. Yes, it is. Because that's three mob bosses, the Italian ambassador and the ceo of lockheed. They can't all be communists. This hellfire club, it's got to be something else. Do you see that? Hello, girls. Wow! Very nice. What are you doing? Using some equipment the CIA didn't give me. Stay put. Colonel hendry? Yes, ma'am. Emma frost. Sebastian Shaw's associate. And where is Mr. Shaw? We're having a party, and here's the entertainment. Come with me. Down like a roller coaster. Back like a loop-the-loop. And around like a merry-go-round. We ate and ate at a hot dog stand. We danced around to a rocking band. And when I could, I gave that girl a hug. In the tunnel of love. You'll never know how great a kiss can feel. When you stop at the top of a Ferris wheel. When I fell in love down at palisades park. Hello, beautiful. How are you? Hey, baby. You want to find a quiet place? I am so sorry. I've been booked by colonel hendry. Excuse me. We ate and ate at a hot dog stand. We danced around to a rocking band. And when I could, I gave that girl a hug. In the tunnel of love. You'll never know how great a kiss can feel. You sure we can't get you a refill, Bob? No. So, I hear you blocked the proposal to position Jupiter missiles in Turkey. I expect you'll reconsider. We've had this conversation. You put our nukes in Turkey or anywhere that close to Russia, and you're looking at war. Nuclear war. I don't ask for favors, colonel. I express my expectations. So, let me say it again. I expect you'll reconsider. The only thing I will reconsider is having another glass of that delicious champagne. What the hell did you put in my drink? You're thinking of running. Hiding. We'd find you, hendry. There's not a fortress in the world that could keep us out. Magnificent. Isn't she, Bob? Genetic mutation. The evolution of the human genome. Where's azazel? Ah. We don't want the colonel to be late. Comrade. Missiles in Turkey send a very clear message. If we ever decide to fire them, the Russian early-warning system won't even have time to kick in. This better be important, mactaggert. Whoa, slow down. Are you smoking them funny cigarettes? People don't disappear. Colonel hendry was there. He was there, mccone, in the hellfire club. Colonel hendry? I agree with you, general. I've reconsidered my position and I now believe we should put Jupiter missiles in Turkey. Colonel hendry is here. So unless he magically traveled 3,000 Miles in the last 10 minutes, listen to me, I suggest that you stop wasting my time. Looks like hendry wants to start world war III. I got bigger things to deal with right now, mactaggert. Sir, I... God! Have you lost your mind? So, now what? We find an expert on genetic mutation. PR ofessor of genetics, Charles Francis Xavier. So, how does it feel to be a Professor? Don't call me that. You don't get to be called a Professor until you actually have a teaching position. I know, but it suits you. Don't say that. Do say, \"let's go have a drink.\" Let's go have a drink. Wonderful. Afternoon, gentlemen. Hot out there. Beer, please. German beer. Of course. Yes, it's bitburger. You like it? The best. What brings you to Argentina? The climate. I'm a pig farmer. Tailor. Since I was a boy. My father made the finest suits in Dusseldorf. My parents were from Dusseldorf. Ah. What was their name? They didn't have a name. It was taken away from them... By pig farmers... And tailors. Blood and honor. Which would you care to shed first? We were under orders... Blood then. Freeze, asshole. Come on, shoot. Who... what are you? Let's just say I'm Frankenstein's monster. And I'm looking for my creator. Drink! Drink! Drink! Yeah! I'm so proud of you. Thank you. I need another drink. And you need another cola. Congratulations, Professor. Thank you very much. It's much harder than it looks, actually. No, on your presentation. You were at my presentation? How nice of you. Thank you very much. Moira mactaggert. Charles Xavier. Do you have a minute? For a pretty little bean with a mutated mcrl gene? I have five. I say \"MCRL,\" you would say \"AUBURN HAIR.\" It's a mutation. It's a very groovy mutation. Mutation, right, took us from single-celled organisms to the dominant form... You know what? This routine may go over great with the co-eds, but I'm here on business. What? I really need your help. All right. The kind of mutations that you were talking about in your thesis. I need to know if they may have already happened. In people alive today. Professor? I think we should just talk when you're sober. Do you have any time tomorrow? Something tells me you already know the answer to your question. This is very important to me, and if I can help you, I will do my utmost. Thank you. Still drinking champagne, Bob? I will pass. Okay, well, so much for the pleasantries. I was wondering who you told about our little arrangement. No one. - He's telling the truth. - Good. Well, I guess we're done here. Let's wrap things up, shall we? Oh, I knew better than to trust you. Now, you let me walk out of here with my money, or I will pull this pin, and we all die. Go ahead. Pull it. I'll do it, I swear to God. No, you won't. But I will. You're one of them? Very astute of you, colonel hendry. You want to guess what I can do? I've got the power to absorb energy. It keeps me young. But that's the boring part. The fun stuff is what I can do with it once I've got it. The advent of the nuclear age may have accelerated the mutation process. Individuals with extraordinary abilities may already be among us. Thank you very much. Mactaggert, you really think that some crackpot scientist is going to make me believe in sparkly dames and vanishing men? You just bought yourself a one-way ticket back to the typing pool. This meeting is over. Please sit down, agent mactaggert. I didn't really expect you to believe me, given that all you could think about during my presentation was what sort of pie they were serving in the commissary. It's apple pecan. I haven't been entirely honest with you, love. I'm sorry. You see, one of the many spectacular things my mutation allows me to do is that I can read your mind. I've seen this before in a magic show. Are you going to ask us to think of a number between one and 10 now? No, agent stryker. Although, I could ask you about your son, William, who you were thinking about, which is very nice. But I think I'd rather ask you about the Jupiter missiles America are currently placing in Turkey. He's a goddamn spy. You brought a goddamned spy into this facility! How's that for a magic trick? Best I've ever seen. I want them out of here. And locked down until I can figure out what to do. My facility is off-site. I'll take them. I can't believe this. You'd think the director of the CIA would have a little more composure. We should be going after Shaw right now. But instead, he's out there worrying about the wrong mutants. What are we going to do, levene? Levene? Levene, what's wrong with you? Absolutely nothing. I've just frozen him for a moment because I'd like to talk to you. It's good, isn't it? I'm as interested in this Sebastian Shaw as you are. If you still want my help, meet me on the third floor of the parking garage. I've always known that there were people like you out there. I've been the laughing stock of this agency for years, but I knew it! You are going to love my facility. - That's going to have to wait. - Why? Agent mactaggert has a lead on Sebastian Shaw, and if we don't move now, apparently, we're going to lose him. What? Not only can he read minds, he can communicate with them as well. Moira and I have just had a lovely conversation. Yes, we did. That is incredible! But I cannot take you anywhere else without permission from upstairs. Like to see one more magic trick? Okay. Get in the car. Good idea. Herr doktor. Little Erik lensherr. He's here to kill you. What kind of a greeting is that... After all these years? Emma. We don't harm our own kind. Ah! Now it's a party. This is the us coast guard. Do not attempt to move your vessel. Stay where you are. They have a telepath. I've lost Shaw. I've lost Shaw. There's something blocking me. This has never happened to me before. I think there's someone like me on that ship. Like you? I'm sorry, a telepath. This is incredible. I could actually feel her inside my mind. I'm very sorry, but I don't think I'm gonna be much help tonight. You're on your own. Oh, my God! Jesus! Get inside. Stop, stop, stop. Charles! Are you okay? There's someone else out there. There. Time to go. Let go! You have to let it go! You've got to put someone in the water to help him. Let it go! You have to let it go! You can't. You'll drown. You have to let go. I know what this means to you, but you're going to die. Please, Erik, calm your mind. Get off me! Get off! Calm down! Just breathe. We're here! Who are you? My name is Charles Xavier. You were in my head. How did you do that? You have your tricks, I have mine. I'm like you. Just calm your mind. I thought I was alone. You're not alone. Erik, you're not alone. Welcome to my facility. My mission has been to investigate the application of paranormal powers in military defense. Or offense. This guy Shaw, schmidt, whatever you want to call him, he's working with the Russians. We might need your help to stop him. Marvelous. So we're to be the CIA's new mutant division, yes? Something like that. It's a supersonic. The most advanced plane ever built. You should see it in real life. It's incredible. Hank, these are the special new recruits I was telling you about. This is Hank McCoy, one of our most talented young researchers. How wonderful. Another mutant, already here. Why didn't you say? Say what? Because you don't know. I am so, so terribly sorry. Hank? You didn't ask, so I didn't tell. So, your mutation is what? You're super-smart? I'll say. Hank here graduated Harvard at the age of 15. I wish that's all it was. You're among friends now, Hank. You can show off. Splendid. I'm sorry. Ta-da! You're amazing. Really? \"The presence of us missiles in Turkey\" \"represents an unprecedented threat\" \"to the people of the Soviet union,\" warned Russian foreign minister gromyko earlier today. But he was quick to insist the Russians would not be the first to initiate any military action. Yeah, we'll fix that as soon as we get to Russia. Unless the CIA find us first. I'll take care of them, too. If that telepath gets inside your head, he won't be as much fun as I am. Already in hand, my love. The Russians made me this. So, what am I thinking? I don't know. I was thinking that you are the most exquisite thing I have ever seen in my life. And that this needs ice. Fetch me some. There's a good girl. I promised myself I'd find a cure ever since I was a little boy. You have no idea what I'd give to feel normal. Normal. Charles has never understood. He's different, but he's never had to hide. Hank, this serum that you're making, it doesn't affect abilities, right? Just appearance. It normalizes it. Yeah. Do you think it would work on me? I can look into it, if you'd like. It's the least I can do after asking you to come down here with such a weird request. I have to admit, usually when guys ask me out, they're not after my blood. Sorry. I didn't intend to be forward. I was just... I was excited. You know, the nature of your mutation. If any genes hold the key to changing appearance, it's yours. Hank, you weren't being forward. That's kind of what I meant. No. But I'm just sorry if you thought I was. And I'm sorry that you weren't. Go ahead. Take the blood. Sorry. Did I hurt you? Kinky. By the way, if I looked like you, I wouldn't change a thing. From what I know about you, I'm surprised you've managed to stay this long. What do you know about me? Everything. Then you know to stay out of my head. I'm sorry, Erik, but I've seen what Shaw did to you. I've felt your agony. I can help you. I don't need your help. Don't kid yourself. You needed my help last night. It's not just me you're walking away from. Here you have the chance to be part of something much bigger than yourself. I won't stop you leaving. I could. But I won't. Shaw has got friends. You could do with some. Hank turned that radar installation into a transmitter. It's designed to amplify brainwaves so it could enhance your telepathic powers, help us find other mutants for our division. What if they don't want to be found by you? Erik. You decided to stay. If a new species is being discovered, it should be by it's own kind. Charles and I find the mutants. No suits. First of all, that's my machine out there. Second of all, and much more importantly, this is Charles' decision. Charles is fine with the CIA being involved. Isn't that right? No. I'm sorry, but I'm with Erik. We'll find them alone. What if I say no? Then good luck using your installation without me. I call it cerebro. As in the Spanish for \"brain.\" Yes. Okay, so, the electrodes connect Charles to the transmitter on the roof. When he picks up a mutant, his brain sends a signal through a relay and then the co-ordinates of their location are printed out here. You designed this? Yeah. What an adorable lab rat you make, Charles. Don't spoil this for me, Erik. I've been a lab rat. I know one when I see one. Okay, great. Are you sure we can't shave your head? Don't touch my hair. Okay. It's working! For that, daddy-o, you get a private dance. You cats know it's double for both, right? Mmm. No, that won't be necessary. Although, I'm sure it'd be magical. We were thinking more, we'll show you ours if you show us yours. Baby, that is not the way it works around here. More tea, vicar? Don't mind if I do. My turn. How would you like a job where you get to keep your clothes on? Where to, fellas? Richmond, Virginia, please. Right, so, you want the airport? The station? What? No, we were rather hoping you would take us all the way. That's a six-hour drive. That will give us plenty of time to talk. What does the government want with a guy like Alex summers? I hope you're not planning on putting him with others. First guy I've ever met who actually prefers solitary confinement. Crazy, huh? What? You like fish. I like fish, too. Maybe we should get a bite sometime, talk about it? I'd rather go out with the fish. These fish? Excuse me, I'm Erik lensherr. Charles Xavier. Go fuck yourself. There's nothing on radar? Nothing. Sonar? Nyet. Then we have a problem. Beautiful, isn't it? The reason we exist. We are the children of the atom, my love. We have a situation. The telepath. I shouldn't be able to feel him at this distance. It's like his reach is amplified. They're recruiting. You go on to Russia. I'll handle them. I can't stop thinking about the others out there. All those minds that I touched. I could feel them. Their isolation, their hopes, their ambitions. I tell you, we are at the start of something incredible, Erik. We can help them. Can we? Identification, that's how it starts. And ends with being rounded up, experimented on, eliminated. Not this time. We have common enemies. Shaw, the Russians. They need us. For now. We should think of code names. We're government agents now, we should have secret code names. I want to be called mystique. Damn! I wanted to be called mystique. Well, tough. I called it. And I'm way more mysterious than you. Darwin, what about you? Well, \"Darwin\" is already a nickname, and, you know, it sort of fits. Adapt to survive and all. Check this out. Whoa! That was incredible. Thank you. What about you? I'm going to be. Banshee. Why do you want to be named after a wailing spirit? You might want to cover your ears. Your turn. My stage name is angel. It kind of fits. You can fly? Uh-huh. And... What's your name? How about big foot? You know what they say about guys with big feet. And yours are kind of small. Okay, now. Alex, what is your gift? What can you do? It's not... I just can't do it. I can't do it in here. Why don't you just do it out there? Alex! Alex! Alex! That's the spirit! Get down when I tell you. \"Get down when I tell you.\" Get back. Get back! Whatever. We have intel that Shaw is meeting with the Russian defense chief in moscow. So go ahead. Say it. I'm not here to say \"I told you so.\" You know why I'm here. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Clearance to bring along your mutants. Fight fire with fire. It makes sense. Wait! You're okay with this? Sending in a bunch of untrained, unauthorized freaks? These freaks are dedicated, hardworking people. Plane leaves for Russia in an hour. I'm telling you, these kids are not ready for Shaw. I think they're gonna surprise you. They're an exceptional bunch of young people. What the hell? Come on! You can go harder than that. Harder! What are you doing? Who destroyed the statue? It was Alex. No, havok. We have to call him havok. That's his name now. And we were thinking, you should be Professor x and you should be Magneto. Exceptional. I expect more from you. We got a problem. What? I'm so sorry. This wasn't on the map. No matter what happens, act normally. I'll take care of this, all right? Now, listen to me... - Where are you going? - To our farm. Open the back. As you wish. Easy, easy. Take it easy, chaps. - Anything back there? - Nothing. It's empty. - Everything okay? - Yes. - Where is Shaw? - I don't know. But if she's a telepath and I read her, she'll know we're here. Let me try something else. Shaw sends his apologies but he's indisposed. He asked me to come in his place. And between you and I, honey, I'm a lot better company. Please, come in. He's not coming. So, what now, boss? Now, nothing. We're here for Shaw. Mission aborted. The hell it is. Erik. She's his right-hand woman. That's good enough for me. The CIA invading the home of a senior Soviet official. Are you crazy? I'm not CIA. Erik! Your health. So, you must be busy planning your next move. What with the Americans refusing to remove their missiles from Turkey. You know I can't talk about those things, miss frost. Emma. And don't worry. You don't have to say a word. He's gonna start world war III single-handed. We have to do something. Like what? We're moving out. You can't! I'm sorry. I can't leave him. For God's sake, Erik! Be calm. Be calm. Forget my face. You are beautiful, so beautiful! Yes! Pathetic. Yes! Nice trick. Who are you? Go to sleep. You can stop trying to read my mind, sugar. You're never going to get anything from me while I'm like this. So, then, you can just tell us. Where is Shaw? Erik. Erik, that's enough. Erik, that's enough! All yours. She won't be shifting into diamond form again. And if she does, just give her a gentle tap. We are the children of the atom. Radiation gave birth to mutants. What will kill the humans will only make us stronger. Beautiful, isn't it? This is worse than we previously imagined. We're taking you with us. CIA will want to question you themselves. Oh, I doubt it. They have bigger things to worry about right now. - Whoa! - All right, all right. Jesus, man, you are killing me. Don't beat yourself up. I've had a lot of spare time. Oh, I didn't know the circus was in town. Hey, come on, honey. Give us a little... No? Come on, let's see the foot. There it is. Come on, big foot, let's go. Hey. Hey, come on. Hey. They're just guys being stupid. Guys being stupid, I can handle. Okay? I've handled that my whole life. But I'd rather a bunch of guys stare at me with my clothes off than the way these ones stare at me. At us. What was that? I don't know. Something doesn't feel right. No news of Shaw? Not a peep. Not even through that back channel? What is that? We have an intruder in the main atrium. Where are the mutants? If you take another step, I'm gonna put you down. Of course you will. But where do I find the more evolved people? Send back-up now! Get back! Do not leave that room. We're under attack! Shoot! Shoot! Where are the mutants? Put that man down or we will open fire! Stay here, my ass! Let's go! Get back! We can help! We can help! Wait! You want the mutants? They're right through that door. Just let us normal people go. We're no threat... - Where is the telepath? - Not here. Too bad. Well, at least I can take this silly thing off. Good evening. My name is Sebastian Shaw. And I am not here to hurt you. Freeze! Azazel. My friends, there is a revolution coming. When mankind discovers who we are, what we can do, each of us will face a choice. Be enslaved or rise up to rule. Choose freely, but know that if you are not with us, then, by definition, you are against us. So, you can stay and fight for the people who hate and fear you, and queens. Angel. Are you kidding me? Come on. We don't belong here. And that's nothing to be ashamed of. We have to do something. Stop. I'm coming with you. Good choice. So, tell me about your mutation. Well, I adapt to survive. So, I guess I'm coming with you. I like that. Alex! Get out! Do it! Protecting your fellow mutants? That's a noble gesture. Feels good. Adapt to this. Hello. Once again, my sympathies for your treatment at the hands of the CIA. These Americans are ruthless. Now they have their missiles placed in Turkey... I expect you'll be planning new missile sites of your own. Somewhere you know the American early-warning system won't help. I hear Cuba is lovely this time of year. And so close to Florida. Missiles in Cuba? You're serious? We may as well declare war. Maybe I wasn't clear enough. You will make this happen. Okay. Let's see what kgb think about this. Hello? General armivolkoff. It's nothing. Raven? We've made arrangements for you to be taken home immediately. We're not going home. What? He's not going back to prison. He killed Darwin. All the more reason for you to leave. This is over. Darwin's dead, Charles. And we can't even bury him. We can avenge him. Erik, a word, please. They're just kids. No. They were kids. Shaw has his army, we need ours. We'll have to train. All of us. Yes? Yeah. Well, we can't stay here. Even if they reopen the department, it's not safe. We've got nowhere to go. Yes, we do. The law says we've got to turn her over. The law applies to human beings. The same laws don't apply to mutants. They're too dangerous. In times like this, security is more important than liberty. There is a war coming, John. Yes, but a war with who? Excellent question. Though I wouldn't call it a war, exactly. That suggests both sides stand an equal chance of winning. Captain, no sign of any American ships. Maintain course, full ahead. The Russians have sent their warheads to Cuba. We have a week before the ship hits the coast. Our fleet can be on this line when the Russian missile ship arrives. If that ship crosses the line, they will have declared war against the United States. And we will have no choice but to retaliate with a full nuclear response. Do we agree? Dispatch the 7th fleet. This is yours? No, it's ours. Honestly, Charles. I don't know how you survived, living in such hardship. Well, it was a hardship softened by me. Come on. Time for the tour. Dear comrades... The United States have dispatched warships for Cuba. This leaves us with no choice. Comrade first secretary... We must send in our fleet. Dispatch the fleet! President Kennedy has signed a formal proclamation setting up a blockade of all missiles bound for Cuba. The Soviet union reacted by terming it. \"A step along the road to unleashing a thermo-nuclear war.\" You're sure? I'm sure. All right. No. No, I can't. I'm sorry. I can't shoot anybody point blank, let alone my friend. Oh, come on. You know I can deflect it. You're always telling me I should push myself. If you know you can deflect it, then you're not challenging yourself. Whatever happened to the man who was trying to raise a submarine? I can't. Something that big? I need the situation, the anger... No, the anger is not enough. It's gotten the job done all this time. It's nearly gotten you killed all this time. Come here. Let's try something a little more challenging. My stepfather took the possibility of nuclear war quite seriously. This way. That is why he had this bunker built down here. I thought we could use it as a practice range of sorts. You don't think I'm going to blow through the walls? He had this place built to withstand a nuclear bomb. I think it can handle you, Alex. You know, when I do this, bad things tend to happen. That's because you can't control it. It controls you. That's why we're here, Alex. It's why we're training. What you're doing is incredible. You're hitting a pitch with sound waves that have the same resonant frequency as the glass. That's why it shatters. But this, it's like any other muscle in the body. You can control it. \"In each of us, two natures are at war.\" Robert Louis Stevenson, Jekyll and Hyde. Top marks. The story wasn't really about good and evil though, was it? It was about man's animal nature and his struggle to control it, to conform. And it's that struggle which is holding you back. No, Jekyll was afraid of what he could be capable of. And you are, too. If you're serious about me doing this, you might want to get back. All right. Shall I shut the door? Yeah. Whenever you're ready. Oh, my God! I will teach you to control this, Alex. And you're sure that this will work? Anything is possible. I based the design... Hank, stop talking. Come on. Now, remember. Scream as hard as you can. You need the sound waves to be supersonic. Catch them at the right angle and they should carry you. They should carry me. That's reassuring. Good luck. And don't forget to scream. Now, if you want to beat me this time, you have to set the beast free. On your marks, get set, go! Congratulations, my friend. Robert Louis Stevenson would have been proud. Impressive, Hank. With feet like those, all you need is a red nose. Right, bozo? I'm done here. Thank you, Alex. Come on, Hank. If you're using half your concentration to look normal, then you're only half paying attention to whatever else you're doing. Just pointing out something that could save your life. You want society to accept you, but you can't even accept yourself. Sexy! Well, this is just the prototype. The real one will look considerably better. It will be a whole suit. See, these sensors measure your energy output. This panel focuses it and the excess is absorbed. Try hitting the one in the middle. Just the one in the middle, mind. Good luck. You got to see this. Your genes are extraordinary, you know that? Your cells age at half the rate of a normal human. When you're 40, you'll still have the leucocytes of a teenager. You have the most incredible cellular structure I've ever seen. And you truly believe I'll fly this time? Unreservedly. I trust you. I'm touched. I don't trust him. Say nothing. I'm gonna die! Look, we're not going to make you do anything you don't feel... Here, let me help. Erik! What? You know you were thinking the same. Wonderful work, Hank. Thank you very much. All right, Alex, I want you to hit the \"X\". And try not to hit me. There's a good chap. You're serious? I'm very serious. I have complete and utter faith in you. Am I still a bozo? Yes, Hank, you're still a bozo. But nice job. See that? Try turning it to face us. You know, I believe that true focus lies somewhere between rage and serenity. Would you mind if I... What did you just do to me? I accessed the brightest corner of your memory system. It's a very beautiful memory, Erik. Thank you. I didn't know I still had that. There is so much more to you than you know. Not just pain and anger. There is good, too. I felt it. When you can access all of that, you'll possess a power no one can match. Not even me. So, come on. Try again. Hey! Well done. The president is about to make his address. It shall be the policy of this nation to regard any nuclear missile crossing the embargo line that surrounds Cuba as an attack by the Soviet union on the United States requiring a full retaliatory response upon the Soviet union... That's where we're going to find Shaw. How do you know? Two superpowers facing off and he wants to start world war III. He won't leave anything to chance. So much for diplomacy. I suggest you all get a good night's sleep. Ultimately leads to war. Tensions mount as the Soviet missile ship nears Cuba. All diplomatic efforts to avert nuclear war have thus far failed. As the American people ready themselves for the likelihood of an atomic attack, there are widespread reports of panic-buying, supermarkets cleared, as shelters unused since the second world war are stocked for what may lie ahead. In all it's history, America has never faced a greater threat. The world is primed for war and there's no one to stop me. Come in. Hey. I have a surprise for you. I isolated the right marker in your DNA sample. The serum works like an antibiotic, attacking the cells that 'cause our physical mutation. It won't affect our abilities, just our appearance. Do you still want to do this? Should we have to hide? Well, you already do. You're hiding right now, like I have my whole life. I don't want to feel like a freak all the time. I just want to look... Normal. Yeah. Hank, don't! You're beautiful, Hank. Everything you are, you are perfect. Look at all of us. Look at all we've achieved this week. All we will achieve. We are different. But we shouldn't be trying to fit into society. Society should aspire to be more like us. Mutant and proud. It behooves me to tell you that even if we save the world tomorrow, and mutants are accepted into society, my feet and your natural blue form will never be deemed beautiful. You look beautiful now. We need this cure. Cuba. Russia, America. It makes no difference. Shaw has declared war on mankind, on all of us. He has to be stopped. I'm not going to stop Shaw. I'm going to kill him. Do you have it in you to allow that? You've known all along why I was here, Charles. But things have changed. What started as a covert mission, tomorrow, mankind will know that mutants exist. Shaw, us, they won't differentiate. They'll fear us. And that fear will turn to hatred. Not if we stop a war. Not if we can prevent Shaw. Not if we risk our lives doing so. Would they do the same for us? We have it in us to be the better men. We already are. We're the next stage of human evolution. You said it yourself! No... Are you really so naive as to think that they won't battle their own extinction? Or is it arrogance? I'm sorry? After tomorrow, they're going to turn on us. But you're blind to it, because you believe they're all like moira. And you believe they're all like Shaw. Listen to me very carefully, my friend. Killing Shaw will not bring you peace. Peace was never an option. No. No, no. No. Well, this is a surprise. The nice kind? Get out, raven. I want to go to bed. Maybe in a few years. How about now? I prefer the real raven. I said the real raven. Perfection. Could you pass me my robe? You don't have to hide. Have you ever looked at a tiger and thought you ought to cover it up? No, but... You're an exquisite creature, raven. All your life, the world has tried to tame you. It's time for you to be free. You know, sometimes I wonder what my life would have been like if you hadn't found me here that night. Sorry, what? You... For God's sake, raven! Where are your clothes? Put some clothes on. That's not what you said when you first saw me. But I guess pets are always cuter when they're little, right? Raven, I don't know what's gotten into you lately. I thought you'd be in a good mood. Hank, he tells me that he's found the answer to your cosmetic problem. Are you gonna tell me what's the matter or do I have to read your mind? You promised me you would never do that. Until recently, I never had to use my power to know what you were thinking, raven. Charles, I used to think it was going to be you and me against the world. But no matter how bad the world gets, you don't want to be against it, do you? You want to be a part of it. What the hell happened here? Hank has been busy. Do we really have to wear these? As none of us mutated to endure extreme g-force or being riddled by bullets, I suggest we suit up. Where is Hank? I'm here. Hank? It didn't attack the cells. It enhanced them. It didn't work. Yes, it did, Hank. Don't you see? This is who you were meant to be. This is you. No more hiding. You never looked better, man. Hank! Don't mock me! Hank, put him down immediately, please. Hank! Hank! I wasn't. Even I got to admit you look pretty badass. I think I got a new name for you. Beast. You're sure you can fly this thing? Of course I can. I designed it. Status of the cargo ship. Bearing 1-8-0 at 12 knots. Three minutes to the embargo line, sir. God help them if they cross it. God help us all. Sound general quarters. General quarters, general quarters! - All hands, man battle stations! - Aye, sir. Set condition zebra! General quarters, battle stations. Captain, we already have our orders. Why so eager for new ones? I lived through one war, comrade. I'd prefer not to start another. Battle stations! Now! Gun boss, target cargo ship bearing 1-8-0. Fleet reports all weapons ready. From the kremlin, sir. New orders. As of 1025 hours, the cargo vessel aral sea is hereby ordered to... Reverse course and return to port in Odessa. Aral sea, come in. They are not responding. She's not turning around. Aral sea, you are ordered to turn around. Do not cross the line. Target ready to be fired upon, sir. Stand by to fire. Standing by, sir. Whoa! It looks pretty messy out there. Aral sea you are ordered to turn around. The crew of the aral sea are all dead. Shaw's been there. He's still here, somewhere. He set the ship on course for the embargo line. If that ship crosses the line, our boys are going to blow it up. And the war begins. Unless they're not our boys. USS independence, this is Alexander nevsky. We have lost control of our cargo ship. She has been instructed to stop. Do not fire! Repeat, do not fire! They have signaled the cargo ship to turn around, sir. It's a ruse. Pay no attention! Stand by to fire. Standing by to fire, sir. On my count. Five, four... Hold on! Nyet. What was that? The Russians. They have fired on their own ship. A little warning next time, Professor. Sorry about that. You all right? Yeah. Son of a... Give me cinclant on the horn. I want a new set of orders. Congratulations, comrade. You just averted nuclear war! What? Take him to the brig. What? What just happened? They say the comrade lost his mind. The Americans are applauding. They're here. That telepath is powerful. We're moving to a back-up plan. That was inspired, Charles. Thank you very much, but I still can't locate Shaw. He's down there. We need to find him now. Hank? Is there anything unusual on the radar or scanners? No. Nothing. Well, then he must be underwater. And obviously, we don't have sonar. Yes, we do. Yes, we do. They are ready for war. We just need to strike another match to light the fuse. And we still have the most powerful weapon of all. Me. Turn the nuclear reactor to 100% output and make sure I'm not disturbed. Hank, level the bloody plane! Whoa! You back right off. Beast, open the bomb bay doors! Remember! This is a muscle. You control it! You'll be in here the entire time! We'll see you soon! On my mark! Three! Two! One! Go! Alert the fleet, they may want to take their cans off. Banshee has got a location on Shaw. Are you ready for this? Let's find out. Remember, the point between rage and serenity. Erik, take my hand! Oh. Hold on, guys. It's gonna get bumpy. Erik, take my hand! Moira? Moira, are you all right? Yeah, I'm okay. I read the teleporter's mind. Shaw is drawing all the power out of his sub. He's turning himself into some kind of nuclear bomb. We got no time. The geiger count is going out of control. Moira, this is what we're gonna do. Get on the radio and tell them to clear both fleets out immediately. I'm going in. Beast, havok, back him up. Erik, I can guide you through once you're in, but I need you to shut down whatever it is that's blocking me, then we just hope to God it's not too late for me to stop him. Got it. Good luck! Raven, stop! I'm going to help them. We don't have time for this. If anything comes in that entrance, you're taking care of it, yes? Fine. Beast! If we go, you go! We believe Shaw is trying to detonate some kind of bomb. Erik, make for the middle of the vessel. That's the point my mind can't penetrate. We have to assume that that's where Shaw is. Gangway! Gangway! Gangway! That's the nuclear reactor. Disable it. Stop! Don't move! Get down! Erik, you're there. You've reached the void. He's not here, Charles. Shaw's not here! He's left the sub! What? He's got to be there. He has to be! There's nowhere else he can be. Keep looking. And I'm telling you he's not. There's no one here, God damn it! Erik. What a pleasant surprise. Erik? Erik. So good to see you again. May I ask you something? Why are you on their side? He's gone. What? He's gone into the void! I can't communicate with him there. Why fight for a doomed race who will hunt us down as soon as they realize their reign is coming to an end? Yeah! Yes! I'm sorry for what happened in the camps. I truly am. He's back! Erik, whatever you're doing, keep doing it. It's starting to work. But everything I did, I did for you. To unlock your power, to make you embrace it. It's working! I'm starting to see him, but I can't yet touch his mind. You've come a long way from bending gates. I'm so proud of you. And you're just starting to scratch the surface. Think how much further we could go together. Look out! Stop! Azazel. I don't want to hurt you, Erik. I never did. I want to help you. This is our time. Our age. We are the future of the human race. You and me, son. This world could be ours. Everything you did made me stronger. It made me the weapon I am today. It's the truth. I've known it all along. You are my creator. Now, Charles! Are you okay? Moira, be quiet. I can only control this man for so long. - Sorry, Charles. - Erik, please. Be the better man. It's not that I don't trust you. Erik, there will be no turning back! No! Charles! Don't do this, Erik! If you're in there, I'd like you to know that I agree with every word you said. We are the future. But, unfortunately, you killed my mother. This is what we're going to do. No. Please, Erik, no. I'm going to count to three and I'm going to move the coin. One. Please, Erik. Two. Three. The Russians share our concerns and will join a strike on all the mutants. We can end this threat for good. We'll never have another opportunity like this. We have an agent on that beach. One agent. She's a good agent. She's collateral damage. Today, our fighting stops! Take off your blinders, brothers and sisters. The real enemy is out there. I feel their guns moving in the water, their metal targeting us. Americans, Soviets, humans. United in their fear of the unknown. The neanderthal is running scared, my fellow mutants! Go ahead, Charles. Tell me I'm wrong. Fleet commander, this is X-ray bravo 7-0. Respond. Over. The beach is secure. Call off the attack. The beach is targeted and ready to be fired upon, sir. Stand by. Standing by, sir. New orders. Fire on the beach. Hello? Hello! Fire! Erik, you said yourself, we're the better men. This is the time to prove it. There are thousands of men on those ships. Good, honest, innocent men! They're just following orders. I've been at the mercy of men just following orders. Never again. Erik, release them! No! I don't want to hurt you. Don't make me! Stand back! Charles, that's enough! Erik, stop! Gentlemen, it's been an honor serving with you. Comrades, thank you for your service. I'm so sorry. I said back off! You. You did this. Erik. Please. She didn't do this, Erik. You did. Us turning on each other, it's what they want. I tried to warn you, Charles. I want you by my side. We're brothers, you and I. All of us together, protecting each other. We want the same thing. My friend. I'm sorry, but we do not. Charles! I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. It's all right. It's all right. This society won't accept us. We form our own. The humans have played their hand. Now we get ready to play ours. Who's with me? No more hiding. You should go with him. It's what you want. You promised me you would never read my mind. I know. I promised you a great many things, I'm afraid. I'm sorry. Take care of him. And, beast, never forget. Mutant and proud. Help me out, come on. I'm gonna get you to a hospital. Wait, Charles. Charles, don't move, okay? I won't. Actually... I can't feel my legs. What? I can't feel my legs. I can't feel my legs. In this week of Thanksgiving there is much for which we can be grateful as we look back to where we stood only four weeks ago. The unity of this hemisphere, the support of our allies and the calm determination of the American people. These qualities may be tested many more times in this decade. So, how many students do you think you'll have here once you get the academy up and running? As many as I can manage. Possibly more. You know, one day the government is going to realize how lucky they were to have Professor x on their side. I suppose I am a real Professor now, aren't I? Next thing you know, I'll be going bald. We're still on the government's side, moira. We're still g-men. Just without the \"g\". No. You're your own team now. It's better. You're X-Men. Yes, I like the sound of that. Moira? For us, anonymity will be the first line of defense. I know. They can threaten me all they want, Charles. I'll never tell them where you are. Ever. I know you won't. I know. I remember the attack on hq, leaving to go somewhere else. And then this morning, I woke up at home. That's it. All that time, wiped clean from your mind. Just gone. He can do that? You don't remember anything? Sometimes I get fragments. Like trees, sunlight. A kiss. Oh, Jesus. Gentlemen, this is why the CIA is no place for a woman. What the hell was that? I know we've had our differences. Where's your telepath friend? Gone. Left a bit of a gap in my life, if I'm to be honest. I was rather hoping you would fill it. Join us. Erik, I believe. I prefer Magneto.", "url": "https://subslikescript.com/movie/X-Men_First_Class-1270798"},
{"title": "X-Men: Days of Future Past (2014) - full transcript", "plot": "In the future, the mutants and the humans that help them are slaughtered by powerful robots named Sentinels. Professor Xavier, Wolverine, Magneto, Storm, Kitty Pryde and her friends meet at a monastery in China and Xavier explains that the invincible Sentinels were created using the DNA of Mystique that was captured in 1973 when she tried to assassinate their creator Dr. Bolivar Trask.

Hey, Storm. Hey, kid. KITTY: Professor, you made it. (SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE) Whenever the Sentinels attack, Warpath spots them... then I send Bishop back to warn us of the attack before it happens. Blink scouts the next site... and then we leave before they ever know we were there. Because... we never were. What do you mean you were never there? She projects Bishop back in time a few days to warn the others... of the coming attack. So she sends Bishop back in time? No, just his consciousness, into his younger self. His younger body. Wow. This might just work, Charles. What might work? The Sentinel program was originally conceived by Doctor Bolivar Trask. In the early '70s, he was one of the world's leading weapons designers. But, covertly, he had begun experimenting on mutants... using their gifts to fuel his own research. TRASK: This is extraordinary. PROFESSOR X: There was one mutant who had discovered what he was doing. A mutant with the ability to transform herself into anyone. Mystique. PROFESSOR X: I knew her as Raven. We met when we were children, grew up together. She was like a sister to me. I tried to help her... but only succeeded in driving her away. She hunted Trask across the world. And at the Paris Peace Accords in 1973, after the Vietnam War... she found Trask... and killed him. (GUNSHOT) It was the first time she killed. It wasn't her last. But killing Trask did not have the outcome she expected. It only persuaded the government of the need for his program. (GASPS) PROFESSOR X: They captured her that day... tortured her, experimented on her. In her DNA, they discovered the secrets to her powers of transformation. It gave them the key they needed... to create weapons that could adapt to any mutant power. And in less than 50 years... the machines that have destroyed... so many of our kind were created.  (LOW GROWL) But it all started that day in 1973... the day she first killed. The day she truly became... Mystique. You want to go back there. If I can get to her, stop the assassination... keep her out of their hands... then we can stop the Sentinels from ever being born. And end this war before it ever begins. Uh, I can send someone back a couple weeks. Maybe a month. But you're talking about going back decades. You have the most powerful brain in the world, Professor... but the mind can only stretch so far before it snaps. It would rip you apart. I'm sorry. No one could survive that trip. What if someone's mind has a way of snapping back? What if someone can heal as fast as they're ripped apart? It's a risk. Yeah, I'm getting that. BISHOP: Not just for you. You do this, you change history. Well, that's kind of the point. Some of us could be killed. Some of us may never be born. We have no idea how things may change. BLINK: We could keep going. Keep fighting. STORM: Until what? You've got a decision to make. You can keep sending Bishop back in time over and over again to warn you, until one day, he doesn't make it, and you all die. Or you can give up this life. So that they and everyone else who died in this war can actually have a future. You're asking us to sacrifice our lives for a future we might not even be a part of. Yes. PROFESSOR X: A second chance. A better chance for everyone. My people need to vote. They just did. They're in. STORM: Okay, spread out. BISHOP: Take your positions. (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) So I wake up in my younger body, God knows where. Then what? You'll need to go to my house and find me. Convince me of all of this. Won't you be able to just read my mind? I didn't have my powers in 1973. Logan, you're going to have to do for me what I once did for you. Lead me, guide me. I was a very different man then. You'll have to be patient with me. (CHUCKLES) Patience is my strongest suit. You'll need me as well. What? MAGNETO: After Mystique left Charles, she came with me... and I set her on a dangerous path. A darker path. It's going to take the two of us, side by side... at a time when we couldn't be further apart. Great. So where do I find you? Well, it's complicated. Are you sure about this? It's not just his power that'll be tested. I've seen what this can do to you. I can handle this. Trust me. I guess I'll see you in the next life. (CHUCKLES) KITTY: Basically, your body will go to sleep while your mind travels back in time. As long as you're back there, past and present will continue to coexist. But once you wake up... whatever you've done will take hold and become history. And for the rest of us, it will be the only history that we know. It will be like the last 50 years never happened. And this world, and this war... the only person who will remember it is you. All right, Logan... I need you to clear your head and to stay as calm as possible. What? What do you mean? If your mind gets rocky, it will be harder for me to hold you... and you could start to slip between past and future. What if I need to get a little rocky? Think peaceful thoughts? Peaceful thoughts... Do you have any good news? Well, you don't really age, so you'll pretty much look the same. BOBBY: You won't have much time in the past. The Sentinels will find us. They always do. And this time, we won't be able to run. We'll have no escape. This is our last chance. You really think this will work? I have faith in him. MAGNETO: It's not him I'm worried about, it's us. We were young... we didn't know any better. We will now. See you all soon. This might sting a little.

We can't support a weapon that targets our own citizens. If these mutants, as you describe... are already living among us... then they are living here peacefully. PARKER: We haven't had an incident in over 10 years. After what happened in Cuba? PARKER: That was never confirmed. We have very real enemies out there... the Russians, the Chinese. We are talking about a tenth of a tenth... of a tenth of our population. Allow me to read something to you. Please. This was acquired by our friends at the CIA. It's a dissertation... written by a mutant at Oxford University. And I quote... \"To Homo Neanderthalensis... \"his mutant cousin, Homo Sapiens...\" which is us... \"was an aberration. \"The arrival of the mutated human species, Homo Sapiens... \"was followed by the immediate extinction of their less evolved kin.\" Well... Now, we are the Neanderthal. Speak for yourself, Dr. Trask. (ALL LAUGHING) (CHUCKLES) You know, when you sent our soldiers to Vietnam... without the weapons they needed to win the war... you underestimated your enemy. (CHUCKLING) You do that with this enemy... Mmm... and it won't be some border skirmish halfway around the world. This time, the war will be for our streets... our cities, our homes... and by the time you see the need for my program... it will be too late... and you will have lost two wars in one lifetime. We are sorry, Dr. Trask... but your Sentinel Program... it ain't gonna fly. (HELICOPTER BLADES WHIRRING) Can I help you, Colonel? Just here to give our boys a proper send-off.

Not just yet. What are you doing with those? Something to make the ride a little smoother. I'm transferring you to a private facility... where we can run a few more tests. (COLONEL SANDERS CLEARS THROAT) Your men are not military. Private outfit. We're authorized to remand these men. Hmm. These troops are going home.

You're not coming with us, are you? My war's not over. The enemy is still out there. The four privates, where did they go? They were headed towards the tarmac. Can I help you? Uh... Yeah, what happened to the school? The school's been shut for years. Are you a parent? (SCOFFS) I sure as hell hope not. Who are you? I'm Hank. Hank McCoy. I look after the house now. You're Beast? Look at you. I guess you're a late bloomer. I don't know what you're talking about, but I'm gonna have to ask you to leave. (GRUNTS) So where's the Professor? There's no professor here. You're pretty strong for a scrawny kid. You sure there's not a little Beast in there? No, he's not here. Come on, Beast. Come on, Beastie. No. (GRUNTS) Hey! I said the school's closed. You need to leave. Not until I see the Professor. There's no professor here, I told you that. Look, kid. You and I are gonna be good friends. (GRUNTS) (GROANS) You just don't know it yet. (GROANS) Professor! (GROANS) (GRUNTS) Professor! (ROARS) (GRUNTS) (HANK ROARS) (LOGAN SCREAMING) (ROARS) CHARLES: Hank? What's going on here? Professor? Please don't call me that. Why? You know this guy? Yeah, he looks slightly familiar. Get off the bloody chandelier, Hank. (GLASS CLINKING) You can walk. You're a perceptive one. I thought Erik... Which makes it slightly perplexing that you missed our sign on the way in. This is private property, my friend. I'm gonna have to ask him to ask you to leave. Well. (SIGHS) I'm afraid I can't do that... because, uh, I was sent here for you. Tell whoever it was that sent you that I'm busy. That's gonna be a little tricky... because the person who sent me was you. What? About 50 years from now. (LAUGHING) I know. Stay with me. Like in the future, 50 years from now? Yeah. I sent you from the future? Yeah. CHARLES: Piss off. If you had your powers, you'd know I was telling the truth. How do you know I don't have my p... Who are you? LOGAN: I told you. Are you CIA? No. You've been watching me? I know you, Charles. We've been friends for years. I know your powers came when you were 9. I know you thought you were going crazy when it started... all the voices in your head. And it wasn't until you were 12... that you realized all the voices were in everyone else's head. Do you want me to go on? I never told anyone that. Not yet, no, but, you will. All right, you've piqued my interest. What do you want? We have to stop Raven. I need your help. We need your help. I think I'd like to wake up now. (SIGHS) What does she have to do with this? CHARLES: So you're saying... they took Raven's power, and what? They weaponized it? Yep. She is unique. Yeah, she is, Hank. LOGAN: In the beginning, the Sentinels were just targeting mutants. Then they began to identify the genetics in non-mutants... who would eventually have mutant children and grandchildren. Many of the humans tried to help us, but it was a slaughter. Leaving only the worst of humanity in charge. I've been in a lot of wars. I'd never seen anything like this. And it all starts with her. Let's just say for the sake of... the sake, that I choose to believe you... that I choose to help you. Raven won't listen to me. (SIGHS) Her heart and soul belong to someone else now. LOGAN: I know. That's why we're gonna need Magneto, too. HANK: Erik? (LAUGHING) You do know where he is? LOGAN: Yeah. (CHARLES LAUGHING) CHARLES: Could you give me that one more time, please? You heard me. (LAUGHING) He's where he belongs. You're just gonna walk out? Ooh, top marks. Like I said, you are perceptive. The Professor I know would never turn his back... on someone who'd lost their path. Especially someone he loved. You know... I think I do remember you now. Yeah. Tall, angry fellow with the contentious hair. We came to you a long time ago... seeking your help. And I'm gonna say to you what you said to us then. Fuck off. Listen to me, you little shit. I've come a long way, and I've watched a lot of people die. Good people. Friends. If you're gonna wallow in self-pity... and do nothing, then you're gonna watch the same thing... you understand? We all have to die sometime. Told you there was no professor here. What the hell happened to him? HANK: He lost everything. Erik, Raven... his legs. (SIGHS) We built the school, the labs, this whole place... then, just after the first semester... the war in Vietnam got worse. Many of the teachers... and older students were drafted. It broke him. He retreated into himself. I wanted to help, do something... so I designed a serum to treat his spine... derived from the same formula that helps me control my mutation. (SIGHS) I take just enough to keep myself balanced... but he takes too much. I tried easing him back... but he just couldn't bear the pain, the voices. The treatment gives him his legs... but it's not enough. He's... He's just lost too much. (SIGHS) YOUNG RAVEN: You're not scared of me? YOUNG CHARLES: I always believed I couldn't be the only one in the world. Charles Xavier. Raven. You're hungry and alone. Take whatever you want. We've got lots of food. You don't have to steal. In fact... you never have to steal again. And that's a promise. CHARLES: I'll help you get her. Not for any of your future shite, but for her. Fair enough. But I'll tell you this. You don't know Erik. That man is a monster. A murderer. You think you can convince Raven to change? To come home? That's splendid. But what makes you think you can change him? Because you and Erik sent me back here together. HANK: The room they're holding him in was built during the Second World War... when there was a shortage of steel. So the foundation is pure concrete and sand. No metal. CHARLES: He's being held... a hundred floors beneath the most heavily guarded building on the planet. LOGAN: Why is he in there? What, he forgot to mention? (SNICKERING) Uh, JFK. He killed... (CHUCKLING) What else explains a bullet miraculously curving through the air? Erik's always had a way with guns. Are you sure you want to carry on with this? This is your plan, not mine. HANK: We don't have any resources to get us in. CHARLES: Or out. It's just me and Hank. I knew a guy. Yeah, he'd be a young man now. Grew up outside of D.C. (CHUCKLING) He could get into anywhere. I just don't know how the hell we're gonna find him. Is Cerebro out of the question? LOGAN: If only you guys had Internet. What's \"Internet?\" (SIGHS) We have a phone book. I thought you'd be getting ready for your trip, sir. I just came to grab a couple files. Is that a new scarf? It's nice. Thank you. (BEEPS) (BREATH TREMBLING) (GASPS) Dr. Trask? One second. Oh. We added some names to the Paris meeting. Thank you. Is something wrong, sir? No. It's nothing. Would you mind typing up my itinerary? I don't wanna miss anything. LOGAN: Here, here, here. CHARLES: Where? Just stop here. All right, all right. LOGAN: Next time I'm driving. Don't get used to it. (CAR DOOR CLOSES) (MAN TALKING ON TV) (SIGHS) What's he done now? I will just write you a check for whatever he took. We just need to talk to him. Peter! The cops are here. Again.

(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING) (PLAYING PING-PONG) PETER: What do you guys want? I didn't do anything. I've been here all day. Just relax, Peter. We're not cops. Of course you're not. If you were, you wouldn't be driving a rental car. How did you know we've got a rental car? I checked your registration when you were walking to the door. I also had some time to kill so I went through your rental agreement. Saw you were from out of town. Are you FBI? No, you're not cops. Hey, what's with this gifted youngsters place? That's an old card. He's fascinating. He's a pain in the arse. What, a teleporter? No, he's just fast. And when I knew him he wasn't so... young. PETER: Young? You're just old. So you're not afraid to show your powers? What powers? What are you talking about? Do you see something strange here? Nothing anybody would believe if you told them. (ARCADE GAME PINGING) So, who are you? What do you want? LOGAN: We need your help, Peter. For what? To break into a highly secured facility... and to get someone out. Prison break? That's illegal, you know. Um... Well, only if you get caught. So, what's in it for me? You, you kleptomaniac, get to break into the Pentagon. How do I know I can trust you? Because we're just like you. Show him. (BREATHES DEEPLY) That's cool, but it's disgusting.

From the future. (SIGHS) How did you lose them? The treatment for my spine affects my DNA. You sacrificed your powers so you could walk? I sacrificed my powers so that I could sleep. What do you know about it? I've lost my fair share. Ha. Dry your eyes, Erik. It doesn't justify what you've done. You have no idea what I've done. I know that you took the things that mean the most to me. Well, maybe you should have fought harder for them. If you want a fight, Erik... LOGAN: Sit down. I will give you a fight! Let him come.

ERIK: I haven't had a real sip in ten years. (SIGHS) (SWALLOWS) I didn't kill the President. The bullet curved, Erik. Because I was trying to save him. They took me out before I could. Why would you try and save him? Because he was one of us. (SCOFFS) You must think me so foolish. We've always said they would come after us. I never imagined they'd use Raven's DNA to do it. When did you last see her? (CLICKS TONGUE) The day I left for Dallas. And how was she? Strong. Driven. Loyal. How... How was she? She was... We were... I could see why she meant so much to you. You should be proud of her, Charles. She's out there fighting for our cause. Your cause. The girl I raised was not capable of killing. You didn't raise her, you grew up with her. She couldn't stay a little girl forever, that's why she left. She left because you got inside her head. That's not my power. She made a choice. But now we know where that choice leads, don't we? She's going to murder Trask, they're going to capture her... and then they're going to wipe us out. Not if we get to her first. Not if we change history tomorrow. I'm sorry, Charles... for what happened. I truly am. It's been a while since I've played. (CLEARS THROAT) I'll go easy on you. Might finally be a fair fight. You have the first move. The diplomats from all around the world are arriving here today at the Hotel Royal. It's an historic day. It's the, uh, official ending of the United States' military involvement in Vietnam. There we have the South Vietnamese Foreign Minister... with other South Vietnamese dignitaries. The Summit doesn't begin for another hour. The hotel has arranged a private room upstairs for your special guests. TRASK: That will be plenty of time. (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) Good afternoon, everyone. Hello, thank you for coming. Congratulations on winning this war. Now, I know you all have hands to shake and photos to take downstairs... so I will get right to the point. There is a new enemy out there. An enemy that will render your arsenals useless... your armies powerless... and your nations defenseless. TRASK: You will need a new weapon for this war. I call them Sentinels. Named after the ancient guardians that stood at the gates of the citadel. (GRUNTS) They have the aeronautic capabilities of a Harrier jet. Armed with guns that can fire off... more than 2, 000 rounds per minute of thermoceramic ammunition. But size, power, speed... you could find that at Lockheed or Boeing. No, what makes the Sentinels so special... is the ability to target the mutant X-gene. A genetic guidance system that can lock onto a mark a half a mile away. (SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) It won't trigger unless it has identified the target. With this weapon, there will be no human collateral damage. If I turn it on, the system couldn't even activate in here. (BEEPING) Unless there's a mutant. (SPEAKING VIETNAMESE) There has to be some kind of mistake. My machines don't make mistakes. (SPEAKING VIETNAMESE) What are you? (MAN SPEAKS VIETNAMESE) I assure you... TRASK: No, don't shoot it. I assure you, I don't know what you're talking about. (SPEAKING VIETNAMESE) (GRUNTING) ERIK: Raven! (GRUNTS) Raven? Raven! (SHUDDERING) Raven? (BEEPING) Charles? We've come for you, Erik and I. Together. RAVEN: I never thought I'd see you again. CHARLES: I made you a promise a long time ago that I would protect you. (GRUNTING) MAN: Wolverine! (GASPING) CHARLES: I'm going to keep you safe. I'm going to keep you out of their hands. Erik? Erik? What are you doing? Securing our future. Forgive me, Mystique. As long as you're out there, we'll never be safe. Erik... Use your power, Charles. Stop him. He can't. (CROWD GASPING) (GROANING) KITTY: He's slipping back. I'm losing him. (PANTING) (GRUNTING) (CROWD EXCLAIMING) (ALL GASPING) LOGAN: Stryker! STRYKER: Someone will finish what we've started, Wolverine! One day! (GRUNTING) (SCREAMS) Restrain him. (CROWD CLAMORING) (GROANING) (SCREAMING) Erik! Where am I? Huh? How the hell did I get here? What? You came to us. Who are you? Charles. Charles Xavier! I don't know you. Huh? What the hell is that? Whoa. Whoa. Look, I can deal with this. Just go. Stop Erik! Erik, please... I'm sorry. Erik... (CROWD SCREAMING) (GROANING) (CROWD SCREAMING) (GASPS) You're Logan, that's Hank McCoy, I'm Charles Xavier. You spent the last couple of days with us. You're on acid. Somebody gave you really bad acid, yeah? (RATTLING) (ALL SCREAMING) (GRUNTS) Just hold on tight, we'll get through this together. (KITTY GROANS) Oh, my God, Kitty. She's wounded pretty bad. (GROANING) (CLAMORING) (ROARING) (KITTY WHIMPERING) I got him. (GASPS) Professor? What happened to you? I just saw someone who's gonna bring me a lot of pain someday. (POLICE SIRENS WAILING) Where's Raven? Gone. What? We have to get out of here. We want to know if there's any sort of connection with... (ALL CLAMORING) Yesterday, the Paris Peace Summit... was rocked by the appearance of unidentified assailants... the likes of which the world has never seen. Mass hysteria has gripped the nation as people ask... \"Where did they come from? Will they be back?\" And most importantly, \"Are they friend or foe?\" That was London correspondent Toby Elliot... reporting from the Paris Peace Summit yesterday. Fuck me. What the hell are we dealing with here? Off the record. Two days ago, this man, Erik Lehnsherr... escaped from a maximum security prison inside the Pentagon. We believe that this woman is a former associate of Lehnsherr's. They were together in Cuba, the day of the crisis in '62. He was also implicated in Kennedy's assassination. What about that thing? MAN: We don't know what that thing is, sir. Actually, we really don't know what any of them are. Yes. Yes, we do. They're mutants. He has the power to control metal. Last I checked, that's what most of your weapons were made of. And she can transform into anyone. A general, a secret serviceman. Even you, Mr. President. She could walk into this office... and order a nuclear strike if she was in the mood. And that's only two of them. Do we have any countermeasures? Any defense? I was waiting for you to ask me that question. That's an experimental program, sir. Strictly off the books. (DOG BARKS) You're telling me these mutants are out in the world... and our best defense are these giant metal robots? Many of the mutants look like us. My Sentinels can tell the difference. I have eight prototypes ready to go. They're built out of a space-age polymer, not an ounce of metal on them. I want to make a demonstration. I want the world to know that we can protect them. What do you need to get these things operational? I already gave that number to Congress. Unfortunately, they elected to shut me down. It's going to cost a bit more to turn them on. NIXON: Whatever you need. TRASK: Oh, and one more thing. If we do manage to capture them, I would like her. For research purposes, of course. I don't care who you screw, as long as it's not me. (NEWSREADER SPEAKING FRENCH) (SPEAKING FRENCH) Terrible thing. What is? Being born like that. Is it? Can you imagine... Looking in the mirror and seeing that staring back at you? Yes, I can. Where do you think she comes from? You think she has a family? Yes. She does. (NEWSREADER SPEAKING FRENCH ON TV) (BEGGING IN FRENCH) If I see so much as a screw move, I will jam this into your throat. How did you find me? You taught me well. It's been a long time since we were this close. I missed you. You tried to kill me. So the rest of us could live. What do you mean? We received a message from the future. Don't lie to me. I never have, and I never will. Humans use your blood, your genes, to create a weapon that wipes us all out. I was only doing what I thought necessary to secure our future. So what's to stop me from killing you right now and securing my future? Nothing. It doesn't matter anymore. They have your DNA. Your blood was on the street. Whose fault was that? Mine. I've seen their plans. They're creating a weapon. And now they have what they need to take it further. We have to strike now, while we still hold the upper hand. I've seen too many friends die, Erik. I don't want a war. I only want the man who murdered them. This is war. What happened to you? Did you lose your way while I was gone? Are you still Charles' Raven? Or are you Mystique? Trask is the enemy. Killing one man isn't enough. It never was for you. Goodbye, Erik. (GRUNTING) LOGAN: What happened? Come on. Can he walk? He needs his treatment. Hank, I can hear them. I know. It's okay. Can you make it stop? I'll get them. (GROANS) LOGAN: Hey, hey. Pull yourself together. It's not over yet. (PANTING) You don't believe that. How do you know? CHARLES: As these go... this comes back. They all come back. Look. I'm still here... and she's still out there. We need your help, Charles. Not like this. I need you. We can't find Raven. Not without your powers. (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) HANK: I added a little extra because you missed a dose. (BREATHING HEAVILY) Charles. (IN HALES SHARPLY) Hank, do me a favor. Would you help me to my study, please? Come on, I got you. (CHARLES GRUNTS) Are you sure about this? Absolutely not. TRASK: This creature is extraordinary. Her genes could hold the key to mutation itself. I need more. That's all they were able to scrape off the pavement in Paris. More than blood. I need brain tissue... spinal fluid, bone marrow. Imagine... Sentinels that could transform, adapt to any target. If I could just get my hands on her. This girl could leap the program forward years... decades into the future. How old is your son now, Major? Jason? He's coming up on ten now, if you can believe it. Eight years from fighting age. And how many of our sons and brothers did we just ship home in body bags? Maybe fifty, fifty-five thousand? And how many more on the other side? Never before... in all of human history... has there been a cause which could unite us as a species. Until now. You really hate, mutants, don't you? On the contrary, I rather admire them. The things they can do. I see mutants as our salvation. A common enemy. A common struggle against the ultimate enemy. Extinction. I believe our new friends... are going to help us usher in a new era, Bill. A new era of genuine... and long-lasting peace. MAN OVER PA: Attention, attention. Transport departure in two hours. Repeat. Transport departure in two hours. (SIGHS) When was the last time you were down here? The last time we went looking for students. A lifetime ago. (ELECTRICAL WHIRRING) AUTOMATED FEMALE VOICE: Welcome, Professor. (SIGHING) HANK: Raven's wounded. She won't be moving fast. (BLOWS) These are muscles I haven't stretched in a long time. (GASPS) (INDISTINCT SHOUTING) (WEEPING AND YELLING) (INDISTINCT SHOUTING CONTINUES) (GROANING) Charles! Charles! (SCREAMING) (GROANS) Charles? It's all right. (PANTING) I'll go check the generator. It's not the machinery, is it? I can't do this. My mind... Yes, you can. (STAMMERING) It won't take it. You're just a little rusty. You don't understand. It's not a question of being rusty. I can flip the switches. I can turn the knobs. But my power comes from here. It comes from... And it's broken. I feel like one of my students. Helpless. It was a mistake coming down here. It was a mistake freeing Erik. This whole thing has been one bloody mistake. I'm sorry, Logan, but they sent back the wrong man. You're right. I am. Actually, it was supposed to be you. But I was the only one who could physically make the trip. And, uh... And I don't know how long I've got here. But I do know that a long time ago... actually, a long time from now... I was your most helpless student. And you unlocked my mind. You showed me what I was. You showed me what I could be. I don't know how to do that for you. You're right. I don't. But I know someone who might. Hmm. Look into my mind. You saw what I did to Cerebro. You don't want me inside your head. There's no damage you can do... that hasn't already been done. Trust me. Come on. (SCREAMING) Hey. (SCREAMING) Hey, Logan. Hi, Jean. Kill me. I love you. (GROANS) (SCREAMING) You poor, poor man. Look past me. No, I don't want your suffering. I don't want your future! Look past my future. Look for your future. That's it. That's it. That's it. (SIGHS) (INDISTINCT TALKING) Charles. Charles. (CHUCKLES) So this is what becomes of us. Erik was right. Humanity does this to us. Not if we show them a better path. You still believe? Just because someone stumbles, loses their way... it doesn't mean they're lost forever. Sometimes we all need a little help. Oh, I'm not the man I was. I open my mind... and it almost overwhelms me. You're afraid, and Cerebro knows it. All those voices... so much pain. It's not their pain you're afraid of. It's yours, Charles. And as frightening as it may be... that pain will make you stronger. If you allow yourself to feel it... embrace it... it will make you more powerful than you ever imagined. It's the greatest gift we have... to bear their pain without breaking. And it's born... from the most human power. Hope. Please, Charles... we need you to hope again. Find what you were looking for? HANK: The power's back on. Yes. Yes, it is. (TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWING) (GRUNTS) (METAL CLANKING) (ELECTRICAL WHIRRING) (BREATHING HEAVILY) (WIND HOWLING) (MOANING) BOBBY: She's lost too much blood. She can't keep going like this. We have no choice, Bobby. We can wake him up. No! They need more time. I had... a glimpse into the past. If we wake Logan now... we may set our fate on an even darker course. They need more time. There is someone else. No, no one has Kitty's power. Someone that could take her power, take her place. She took yours once. Rogue. I'm sorry, Bobby, she must be dead. I haven't been able to make a connection with her for years. That's because they're keeping her in the one place your mind can't reach from the outside. She's in Cerebro. She's in your house, Professor. They're experimenting on her. Trying to tap into her power, so they can take ours. Take all of ours. If you knew this, why didn't you go after her? We tried. It's too heavily guarded. I may know a few things about that house they don't. BOBBY: Kitty, I'm going to get help. I'm gonna bring back somebody to help you. Please, just bring yourself back. (WOMAN ANNOUNCING IN FRENCH OVER PA) Raven, stop. Stop running. Charles? Where are you? Back at the house... where you should be. I need you to come home. I know what I need to do. If you kill Trask... you will be creating countless more just like him. Then I'll kill them, too. Those are Erik's words, not yours. Oh! The girl I grew up with wasn't capable of killing. She was good... fair, full of compassion. I have compassion. Just not for Trask. He's murdered too many of us. Shut her down, Charles. Get in her head. CHARLES: She's not letting me in. I'm barely holding on. I'm not strong enough yet. (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) (GASPS) I know what Trask has done... but killing him will not bring them back. It will set you on a path... from which there is no return. An endless cycle of killing. Us and them, until there is nothing left. But we can stop it, right now, you and I. You just have to come home. I have to? You haven't changed at all, Charles. Like I said... I know exactly what I have to do. You do? Then, wherever you go, I will find you. And, Raven, if you make me, I will stop you. Good luck, Charles. (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) Where is she? (CHUCKLES) She's in an airport, boarding a plane. She could be going anywhere. (SIGHS) LOGAN: Get some rest, Charles. We'll track her in the morning and find out exactly where she's going. MAN ON TV: Rockets did land outside the base, killing five civilians and wounding 12 others. (KNOCKING) Yeah? You know that those things can give you cancer? I've done some toxicology tests in the lab, and... You want something? Yeah, I'm... I know it's complicated, and there's probably all kinds of rules and reasons for what you can and can't say, but I was wondering if you could tell me in the future, do I make it? No. Oh. Okay. It's okay. Thanks. Hey, kid? It's just the world I came from. We're going backwards in time. Tomorrow, in front of the White House, the President will make his announcement. He will be joined by Secretary of Defense Laird... and has even sought the help of renowned scientist Bolivar Trask... his special advisor to combat this mutant issue. (THUD) The White House has asked all three networks to air the event live, as it is a matter of importance not only to the United States, but to every citizen from around the globe. There are no other details about the event... Raven... My God. I don't understand. What are you doing here? I, uh... I guess, I just realized I have nowhere else to go. I've gotta wake Charles... No, don't. Just wait. You really shouldn't walk on this. I've had worse. So, you've been living here all these years? Someone had to take care of Charles. You know, he's missed you. He misses who I was. I'm not who he wants me to be anymore. I've missed you. So, you're like this all the time now. Like what? This. No, not all the time. I take a shot in the morning, and I need another if I get worked up. Worked up? Yeah, yeah, when I'm... emotional or excited. Any animal urges. Hmm. Usually, I can fight them off. Well, maybe, we shouldn't have to fight off the things that come naturally to us. (GROWLING) Do you remember one of the last things you said to me? That I would never be deemed beautiful, looking like this? Do you still think that? Maybe. You saw what happened in Paris. You know what they think of us. What do you think? I think you're beautiful. What about yourself? You should get some rest. I'm glad you're home. Hank? Do you remember the last thing I said to you? It was, \"Mutant and proud.\" (SIGHS) PROFESSOR X: The old gas and water pipes lead straight to the house. The walls are made of reinforced steel. In other words, a door. (CREAKING) PROFESSOR X: You're walking directly over the hall now. (CLANKING) (HISSING) I've been on that slab. Let me show you how it feels. Rogue, Rogue, come on. Wake up. BOBBY: Rogue. Come on, Rogue, wake up. Wake up, it's me. No. (GROANING) (IN HALES SHARPLY) (PANTING) (ROGUE MOANS) Rogue, Rogue, Rogue, it's okay. He's with me. We're gonna get you out of here. PROFESSOR X: Erik, Bobby. Get out of there! Now! (SCREAMS) (GASPS) Take her! Bobby! No! Bobby! (STRAINING) (SCREAMS) ROGUE: Bobby! (EXPLOSION) Professor! Get us out of here. Bobby. I know. (ENGINES WHIRRING) (SCREAMS) (ROARING) (THUDDING) I'm sorry, Charles. Where's Bobby? I'm sorry, Kitty. (SOBBING) (GASPS) Hello, Logan. (GASPS) Rogue. (DOOR OPENS) Raven was here. I screwed up. Shit. We can't track her now. She's cut her ties. Hey, I saw in the news last night there's going to be an announcement in Washington this afternoon about a new protocol for mutants. I set the system I designed... to record any news about Paris over all three networks... and PBS. All three? Wow. Yeah, and PBS. Look what I found. Tomorrow, in front of the White House, the President will make his announcement. He will be joined by Secretary of Defense Laird... and has even sought the help of renowned scientist Bolivar Trask... his special advisor to combat this mutant issue. The White House has asked... CHARLES: Raven doesn't realize... that if she kills Trask at an event like that... with the whole world watching... Then I came a long way for nothing. And there's more bad news. I saw in a report... they found traces of her blood in Paris. For all we know, they already have her DNA... which is all they'd need. To create the Sentinels of the future. There's a theory in quantum physics... that time is immutable. It's like a river. You can throw a pebble into it... and create a ripple, but the current always corrects itself. No matter what you do, the river just keeps flowing in the same direction. What are you trying to say? What I'm saying is... what if the war is inevitable? What if she's meant to kill Trask? What if this is just simply who she is? Just because someone stumbles, loses their way... doesn't mean they're lost forever. No, I don't believe that theory, Hank. And I cannot believe that is who she is. CHARLES: Ready the plane. We're going to Washington. (BEEPING) You all right? Getting there. (SIGHS) Whatever happens today, I need you to promise me something. You've looked into my mind and seen a lot of bad... but you've seen the good, too. The X-Men. Promise me you'll find us. Use your power, bring us together. Guide us. Lead us. Storm. Scott. Jean. Remember those names. There are so many of us. We will need you, Professor. I'll do my best. Your best is enough. Trust me. (WIND HOWLING) There's 12 carriers inbound, 10 miles! They've found us. REPORTER: Thousands of people will be gathered here today. They've come from all over the world... to witness history, along with news crews... from at least 50 different countries. Thank you. (BEEPS) Can I see your invitations, please? Yes, you may. These two are with me. Go ahead. Thank you. CHARLES: Logan! SECURITY OFFICER: Please, this way, sir. Fourth infantry... Took a Bouncing Betty. What happened to you? Friendly fire. The worst kind. Yeah. (INDISTINCT VOICES) I haven't found her yet, but she has to be here. ANNOUNCER: The President of the United States. (PATRIOTIC MUSIC PLAYS) (CROWD CHEERING) My fellow Americans... today we face the gravest threat in our history... mutants. (VOICES RESUME) We have prepared for this threat. (INDISTINCT VOICES IN HEAD) In the immortal words of Robert Oppenheimer... \"Behold. \"The world will never be the same again.\" (PATRIOTIC MUSIC PLAYING) (CROWD CHEERING) (COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO) Can I help you? No, you can't. (STATIC) Here they come. (INDISTINCT VOICES IN HEAD) RAVEN: This is for you, brothers and sisters. Raven? I have her. (WITH RAVEN'S VOICE) Let me go, Charles. There. You see? Secret Serviceman. Left of the stage. Got him. CHARLES: Go. (SENTINELS POWERING UP) What the hell are you doing? I didn't tell you to activate them. I didn't. (CROWD GASPING) CHARLES: Raven, please, listen to me. We've been given a second chance to define who we are. Don't do this. Gentlemen, you cannot pass this point. We can't stop that many. No, but we can slow them down. (CROWD CHEERING) (SCREAMING) Erik! (SCREAMING CONTINUES) (SCREAMING CONTINUES) Ah! (PANTING) Storm! (GROANS) (SNARLS) (YELLING) Go, go, go!

MAN 2: All our air defenses are ready one. NIXON: What the hell happened out there? I will fix it. You said that before. I wanted to make a statement. Now the whole goddamn world knows we can't protect them. TRASK: I will fix it. NIXON: You damn well better. (GRUNTS) (CROWD SCREAMING) Charles! No, no, no...

(MEN SHOUTING) TRASK: No, no, no! Don't kill it! I need it alive. (RUMBLING) (GRUNTING) What the hell has happened? (METAL CREAKING) (ALL GROANING) (IN HALING) (GROANS) You built these weapons to destroy us. Why? Because you are afraid of our gifts. Because we are different. Humanity has always feared that which is different. Well, I am here to tell you... to tell the world... you are right to fear us. We are the future. We are the ones who will inherit this earth. And anyone who stands in our way... will suffer the same fate as these men... you see before you. Today was meant to be a display of your power. Instead I give you a glimpse... of the devastation my race can unleash upon yours. Let this be a warning to the world. And to my mutant brothers and sisters out there... I say this. No more hiding. No more suffering. You have lived in the shadows... in shame and fear for too long. Come out. Join me. Fight together in a brotherhood of our kind. A new tomorrow... that starts today. (GROANS) MAGNETO: All those years wasted... fighting each other, Charles. To have a precious few of them back... (GROANS) Mr. President, sir. Stand down. I said, stand down! You want to make a statement? Kill me. Fine. But spare everyone else. (GRUNTING) Very heroic, Mr. President... but you had no intention... of sparing any of us. The future of our species begins now. (GUNS COCKING) (BEEPING) (GASPING) You used to be a better shot. Trust me, I still am. Get out of my head, Charles! Raven. Please, do not make us the enemy today. Look around you. We already are. (BREATHING HEAVILY) CHARLES: Not all of us. All you've done so far... is save the lives of these men. You can show them a better path. Shut her down, Charles. I've been trying to control you ever since the day we met... and look where that's got us. Everything that happens now... is in your hands. (BREATHING DEEPLY) I have faith in you, Raven. (EXHALES) RAVEN: He's all yours, Charles. (GRUNTS) If you let them have me, I'm as good as dead. You know that. I know. Goodbye, old friend. Goodbye, Erik. (HELICOPTER HOVERING) (SIGHS) HANK: Are you sure you should let them go? CHARLES: Yes. I have hope for them. There's going to be a time, Hank, when we are all together. HANK: What about Logan?

Yeah. Yeah, I think it is. You did it. Did what? Logan, don't you have a class to teach? A class to teach? History. History? Actually, I could use some help with that. Help with what? Pretty much everything after 1973. I think the history I know is a little different. Welcome back. It's good to see you, Charles. It's good to see everyone. Well... I had a promise to keep. You and I have a lot of catching up to do. Yeah. What's the last thing you remember? Drowning. CHARLES: The past. A new... and uncertain world. CHARLES: A world of endless possibilities. And infinite outcomes. You kidding me? Oh, he's alive! (COUGHS) CHARLES: Countless choices define our fate. Each choice, each moment... a ripple in the river of time. What do you want us to do with him, Major Stryker? CHARLES: Enough ripples... and you change the tide. I'll take him from here. CHARLES: For the future is never truly set.

But then, when we tried to get it out, it was stuck. No matter what we did, we just couldn't get it out. We were just stuck there, looking at each other we don't know what to do with my phone up his ass. We had no insurance, no money. So we decided to each... Shut the fuck up and eat my pussy! Good boy. Looks like you missed the spot. There was this time when my boyfriend and I attended a summer wedding by the Mediterranean Sea. We ended up fighting and I remember feeling this longing to be next to the water, to find solace in the magical light of dawn. I wanted to reconnect with myself and to the sensuality of nature.

I'll see you in a bit. [Alarm blaring] Morning, dude. Hey. Good morning. [Shower running] I love the new script. It's a beautiful world you've set up. I mean, it needs some work, but it's getting there. I have some questions. Okay, cool. Now, you have one character that's going to be played by three different actors. Yes. Why? Um... well, I mean, it's about-- it's about growth. It's about how he evolves as a person. It's about how he sees himself as a different person, in each different stage of his life. Okay. I don't think it makes sense, but you seem to think it's a good idea, so I'm confused. Yeah, I really think it can work. And the, um, cross-cutting of the stories, don't you think it would be a lot easier if it were told linearly? A lot easier to follow, you know, told in order? Well, yeah, I think it would be a lot easier to follow, yeah. Um, but, I don't think it would be very interesting. I have a secret for you. I showed it to Warner Brothers. You showed it to Warner Brothers? I just wanted to give them a taste. It's not ready. Why would you do that? You said you weren't going to do that. I know, I know, but the point is, they're excited. They're really, really excited. They love the idea. They're looking for a high concept sci-fi for a summer release. They think this could be huge. They think this could be the one. Really? They really like it? Yeah, but they have some concerns. Okay, what kind of concerns are you talking about? Big concerns? Small concerns? Well, they're concerned about three actors playing one role and the fucking cross-cutting of the stories bullshit. They also need you to end with a big chase sequence. Wow. Okay, that's some real shit. Look, if you want to do a movie for an audience of five hipsters in Williamsburg, you go right ahead. I'm not in the business of making crap, okay? You have a great idea.

Um, but I don't do this on a regular, or, like, at all. That's okay. So you can tear it up, you can throw it away, you can clean up coffee with it, um, whatever. Okay. Okay. I think I'm gonna go now. Um, should I give you, like, a reward or something? No, I mean, like, I hardly found it, so don't worry about it. Okay, well, thank you. All right. Oh, my gosh, I'm so sorry. Hi. I'm late. I got caught up at work. On a Sunday? Yeah, we're slammed. Got a lot to do. Thank you! Mani mani! Jen, you don't have a job. Why are you getting manis? It was nothing. It was cheap. Did you pick this colour? She suggested it. Ugh, you don't like it. No, it looks great. I like it. It makes me smile. Good! WOMAN: Ready now? Yeah, we're coming. No waiting. Now or no \"scrubbu\". No scrubbu. [Laughing] Let's go. JEN: I had a vodka soda and he had two more pilsners. And then I had a cosmo, and he had two more pilsners. Are you listening to me? Yeah. Can you look at me? Jen, I can hear you. Hi. Hi. He sounds like a winner. I really felt a connection. What happened to... Don? Doug? Don? Doug? Oh, yeah, Doug. What happened? I stopped calling him. He just wanted to do me, like, all the time. Oh, who says \"do me\"? He wanted to do me. To do me, like all-- like, literally all the time. And I was like, it's not even that good, so. I cut that cord. Really? 'Cause I thought you said you liked him. Okay, well, maybe he stopped calling me. [Both laughing] Oh, my god... I'm so fat! You're so ridiculous! Johnny, he's just so cute. He's just-- He's like tall, and he's like not the kind of guy that I would normally be into, but you know, maybe a change is good. Maybe I need a change. Maybe I need to just, like, do something that's, like, out of the ordinary. Maybe then it will work, you know? Oh, my god, I forgot to tell you, I met, like, the cutest, cutest guy at the coffee shop. Like, you guys-- like, you talked to him? Well, sort of. What do you mean? Well, I ordered coffee. And then? And then I asked for some sugar, and then I, like, slipped him my number on a piece of paper, the napkin. On a napkin, like you're in junior high? Yeah! No, well, he thought it was really cute, 'cause he gave me his number too. And there were all these people on the train, at 5:00 in the morning, and I was like, \"Where is everybody going?\" To work. To work? Yeah. I was like, \"I need to be amongst the working class.\" Yeah, you do. That's where I want to be. You know? Like everybody was together on the train, they were heading somewhere. Revelations. Well... You should start looking for a job. It's been like three weeks, right? Yeah. I need a moment. I just need to get myself together. Okay, I guess that's the responsible thing to do. Are you okay? Are you mad at me? Did I do something wrong? Jen. No. It has nothing to do with you. I've just been having a really rough week. Do you want to talk about it? So... Mark and I are not speaking. What? He moved out. What happened? Well... we weren't communicating, and then last weekend I just realized that he's a child, and he doesn't want to grow up, so... I mean, I can't live like that. Okay, I need a lot more details than that. You can't just drop that one on me. Well, I confronted him about being loud at the restaurant last weekend. You were there. You saw him. He was being a complete asshole. Oh, it was me who made that thong joke. I thought it was funny. It wasn't funny. I thought it was. Okay, why would you even say that, Jen? What? You're just gonna take his side. You don't even know the rest of the story yet. No, I'm not. It was a joke, and I thought it was funny. Well, I thought it was embarrassing. So that's why he left? Because of a joke? You guys couldn't figure that out? No. Well, yes, but he was leaving before that. I told him about Jason. Oh, my god. You didn't. Yes, I did. I just said I did. He must've flipped. No, he didn't. That's the point, Jen. He doesn't talk. He didn't want to talk about it. How am I supposed to live with someone like that? Mark is a good guy. And he loves you. I mean, he has every right to be upset. So, what, you think that this is all just my fault? He's got no responsibility? Sylvia, you did fuck up. It's more complicated than that, Jen. Relationships are complicated. I think I know about relationships. Oh, really? 'Cause when was the last time you were in one? I haven't found a guy that's good enough. Okay, well, I don't think that's the problem, but whatever. Relationships take work. That's not really something you understand. Okay, I wouldn't understand? I'm not the one who just fucked up my relationship of six years. I may not know what it's like to be in a long-term relationship, but I do know that it requires respect. Respect? Yes. Oh, you mean like the kind of respect you get when you sleep with a guy on the first date? Don't talk to me about respect, Jen. Please, go. Are you serious? I'll take that. No, it's fine. I don't want your money, okay? Okay. Fine. I'll talk to you later. I'll call you, or something. Bye. It's Johnny, leave a message. Hey, do you mind if I smoke, please? Cool, thanks. [Knocking] [Knocking] Can I help you? Uh, yeah, is Johnny here? Who are you? Who are you? I'm his wife. Oh... Oh. Uh, can I help you? No, I just thought that I would stop by and say hi. I was in the neighbourhood. Hey. What are you doing here? Uh... How do you two know each other? We, uh, we went to college with each other. Yeah, we were in school together. Hamilton. All right, you know what? He's not my friend. Actually, we met on OKCupid, and we went out on a date last night, and I came up here to get my bag. I am so sorry. He did not tell me that he was married. Can I just have my bag? What? What do you mean, what? Go get her bag. I'm so sorry. Did you sleep with him? Yeah. I did. In my bed? I didn't know it was your bed. Do you have an STD? No! No, I am clean. I'm absolutely clean. Good, because I have a mild case of herpes, and so does Johnny. I hope you get it. Excuse me. Here.

Um... sometimes I don't know what I want. But that doesn't-- That doesn't make me a bad guy. So you're right. I am unhappy. But I really love you. And I'm willing to try and make this work if you are. I am. So... So. How do we start? ♪", "url": "https://subslikescript.com/movie/XY-2790182"},

Never thought we'd see you back here again. Yeah. Well, I'm not exactly thrilled about it. Yeah. You said this place made you crazy. I decided I'd rather be crazy than hungry. \"The calculation is sensitive to the time you plan to own your house. \"The factor increases if you pay off your mortgage in five years.\" Five years? He'd be lucky if he paid off the movers. Who could pay off a house in only five years? Hey, rock stars don't even need that long. They pay cash. \"A million dollars, man? See my manager. I'm busy, you know.\" Last one in, first one home. Hey, it's Sonny. It's Michelangelo Malone. Michelangelo, glad you're here. The ceiling needs painting. Uh-huh, all right, that's enough. Well, the great Sonny Malone returns to AirFlo Records, welcomed by cheering throngs of thousands. Art world fails to suffer. News at 11:00. Cut it out. You know I wouldn't come back to all this unless I had to. You know, we were all really pulling for you. Yeah, you know, like one of us breaking away. Going out on his own. Really doing it. Yeah, no paint by numbers, no assembly line art. So what happened? It's what didn't happen. No bread. I fought it, that's for sure. Don't worry. I spend my whole life painting what other people want. I paint his van. I paint somebody else's mural. I paint Simpson's album covers. Then when I finally quit to freelance, not only do I almost starve to death, but I can't figure out what I wanna do. Well, you can try it again. You will, won't you? Look who decided to drop in. Where's your white flag? You have a way with words, Simpson. You know that? Same old wise-ass attitude. I thought we discussed this on the phone when I decided to take you back. We did. But I have one question. Why the hell did you take me back? Simple. You're good, and you're the fastest painter around. But this time no more artsy-craftsy Sonny Malone touches, huh? Just enlarge the album cover the way I give it to you. Am I coming in loud and clear? Yeah. Good. Here. You're on your way to your next masterpiece. Get started. That's great, isn't it? Picasso only gets to be called a genius. I get to be called the fastest painter around. Hey, Sonny, I have this terrific friend. You interested? Not right now. Hey. Mmm, she's great looking. I think that's this crazy girl I just ran into. Yeah? I was walking through the park. She nearly ran over me, then she kissed me. Okay, now, let's hear the X-rated version. What did you do? Nothing. She took off. She took off? Come on! Is this the same Sonny Malone that drives women crazy? I'm gonna go find out who she is. You mean right now? Hey, you're definitely gonna be a successful artist, Malone. You know why? - Because you're nuts! - Simpson's gonna kill him. Listen, Sonny, I told you. I don't know who she is. She never filed a W-2 and she never got a check. And if I never paid her, she just doesn't exist. What do you mean, she doesn't exist? I'm looking right at her. She's on the Nine Sisters album. Not if I didn't pay her, she isn't! Down here at me. Now look to your right. Yeah, that's good. Listen, Sonny, I don't know who she is. How can you not know who she is? You took the picture. Listen, this sounds strange, but there wasn't supposed to be a model on this cover. I snapped maybe 100 shots. In one of them, this girl just jumped into frame. The next time I saw her was on the contact sheets. I liked it, so I used it. That's the whole story. She just appeared? No, no, appeared then disappeared. Now, don't you go spreading this around. This is one of my best covers. Why do you want to know who she is, anyway? I like her. Hey, Lou. You seen her around here? No. Pretty. Hey, you're single, right? Let me show you my daughters. That's great, Lou. I'm gonna go look where I saw her this morning. Come on, get your balloons. Seventy-five cents. - I'll meet you later. - All right. Come on, come on over here. Hi. Hi. I'll take one, please. There you go. See you. All right, come on now. Hey, mister. What are you doing up there? Hope you don't mind a little noontime music, kid. A little lunchtime serenade? I don't mind. It's kind of nice. But I was just wondering where they laid out the body. I mean, you got something a little more upbeat? Sure. Better? At least it's faster. Here, give me a hand, kid. Sure. Boy, oh, boy, they sure don't make rocks like they used to. Want some popcorn? Yeah, thanks. You work around here, kid? Pretty near. I'm over at AirFlo Records. You in the music business? What are you? Are you a record producer? A sound engineer? No. I'm sort of a painter. You, you paint at a record business? Well, not exactly paint. What I do is, I duplicate record covers. But why? I make album covers bigger so you can hang them outside record stores. Promotion. Sounds like an interesting job, huh? Yeah. Sounds like you should take real long lunch hours. You got it. You know, I used to be in the music business, but now I'm what you might call retired. It's a refined name for \"bum.\" I don't believe it. Hey! Hey, wait a minute! Hey, kid. Hey, wait up! Where are you going? Hey, you! Come on! Hold on! Oh, hi. Listen, I gotta borrow this. I'll bring it back. Sure. If you bring it back in person. You got it. Hey! Hey, wait a minute! Where are you going? Get that bike off the pier! Oh, shit! Whoo! You're a real Errol Flynn, kid. What other stunts do you do? Man, this whole thing is screwing me up. What whole thing? Ah, nothing. Come on, have a cup of coffee. Sometimes the best person to tell something to is a stranger. Go on. What's on your mind? Okay. I run into this girl this morning. Never saw her before in my life. She kisses me and disappears. So what's so weird about that? What's so weird about that is that 10 minutes later I see her picture on an album cover I'm supposed to paint. I mean, that's crazy, right? Well, if I said it sounded crazy, would you stop looking for her? No. Then why ask? So I'll keep looking for her. Okay, kid, but take a tip from me. What's that? Don't look underwater anymore. Thanks a lot. Hey, Al, where you going? Hey, Sonny. It's good to see you, man. How you doing, Big Al? How could I go wrong with the great paint job you did on my van? Hey, and the chicks love it. Yeah. It's one of the finer examples of my work. It's beautiful, man. Where you headed? East. Where you going? West. Hang on. I'll give you a ride. No, that's cool. Forget it. I owe you one. All right. Okay, hit it. Relax and enjoy it, man. We're taking the scenic route. Yeah, just don't forget I'm back here. Hey, that's the place on the album cover! Slow down, I wanna get off here. Here? Thanks for the ride.

Now I've seen you three times in one day. That's a little too coincidental. Sounds like you don't believe it. Well, with all that's happened to me today, to tell you the truth, I don't believe it. You're right. It's too coincidental. Someone must be setting us up. What do you mean? Hey, wait a minute! I didn't have anything to do with this! Really? Yeah, really, I didn't. Hey! Who said I was talking about you? You come here often? Yes. I can practice my skating and no one bothers me. You must live around here then. Sometimes. Say, you think we could… See each other again? Yeah. Would you like that? Why? I don't know. I don't have a very good reason. I'd just like to see you again. Where are you? I don't know where I'm supposed to look. ♪ Bring all your dreams alive ♪ ♪ For you ♪ We'll see each other again. Bye, Sonny. How'd you know my name? Hey, wait a minute! I don't know your name. Kira. Kira. I was in big trouble. So what did you do about it? Nothing. Hi, Sonny. What are you doing here? It's early. Yeah, it's really early. I'm working. Well, that's wonderful. Oh, hello there. Why, do you know you bear a strong resemblance to a fellow by the name of Sonny? Oh, yeah. He works here. Always comes in late, though. Say, that's pretty damn good. It is. It's too good. That's what's wrong with it. It is supposed to look exactly like the album cover I gave you. Is that too difficult? If you want me to work, I'll work. If you want to stand there and argue, I can get into that, too. Don't be a wise ass, Malone. That painting should be done. What are you wasting all this time on the girl for? Because that's how she really looks. I don't give a damn how she really looks. Just get it finished. Now, when are you gonna have it done? Well, I'd say it probably will be done when it's done. But that's only an approximate guess. Five minutes, my office. If it's six, keep walking. Sonny, what did you do? Nobody likes it, but we all say yes and then forget it. It goes with the job. Four minutes. What difference does it make? I'll say it's Tuesday, he'll say it's Wednesday. So, big deal. Tell him it's Wednesday. What does it cost? Oh, nothing. Maybe just the truth. Just go in there and agree with him. That's all he wants. You want me to say that Tuesday's Wednesday, right? Everyday of the week. Three and a half minutes. All right! I'll be right back. Sit down. You think you're pretty special around here, don't you? No. I never said I was special. Well, you're not. I mean, you didn't discover art, you know. Who do you think did that? I did. Surprises you, doesn't it? No, not really. Now, I've got an office, I make a lot of money, and people respond when I call. That's because I smartened up and I gave up art. I think you made the right decision. I want you to smarten up, too. Start doing things the company way, not the way you want to do them. But sometimes I see more in these covers than what's really there. That's art. Just paint what you're told to paint. If you start making changes, then other people start making changes. And before you know it, you got a lot of people running around, doing what they want to do. That's not a company. That's chaos. Now, I want you to hang some of your precious covers. Pick up the van and hustle your butt over to the Platinum Palace. Tuesday's Wednesday. Hey, clarinet. How you doing? Hey, what do you say, kid. What're you doing up there? Trying to get down. Grab a hold of the ladder. Sure. Hey, if we keep meeting like this, we might as well introduce ourselves. Sonny Malone. Danny McGuire. Malone and McGuire. Sounds like a vaudeville team. What you got there? Oh, this is a real gem. I've been waiting months for it. Ah, Glenn Miller. You wouldn't know about him. He was before your time. So was Beethoven, but I know who he is. Do you like Glenn Miller? Do you like rock and roll? I love rock and roll. I love Glenn Miller. This place is incredible. It belonged to a silent movie star. Obviously, they did things big in those days. What do you do with all this space? Nothing really. But I love this room because it makes my records sound great. Well, I've only got one thing to say. Remember, I gave you some popcorn. Okay. But you came here to listen to Glenn Miller. So, all set up. There he goes. Nothing like that sound, huh? That sound was a miracle. Hey, Danny, that's you. Yeah. Hey, this girl… Danny, there's this girl… Listen. That's me. Hey, that's all right. You got any more surprises? This is what I call my memorabilia room. Sort of the story of Danny McGuire. Tommy Dorsey, Benny Goodman. You really knew those guys? Yeah. We used to all hang out together. After I toured with Miller, I got my own band and my own club on West 51 st Street. It was small and jam-packed, but everybody who was in town would drop by. Sometimes they'd sit in for a set or two. Well, now it's a parking lot. Why did you give it up? Oh, it was one of those turning points where you turn in the wrong direction. It was a girl. The girl on the album. Yeah. The singer with the band. When she left, I figured she'd be back, and I wasn't about to run after her, right? Boy, did I teach her a lesson. Never saw her again. After that, the heart went out of my music. I went into the family construction business and became what they call comfortable. Three cheers for comfort. You ever think about going back into music? No. Only about 20 or 30 times a day. So, you gonna do it? Well, I can't play clarinet like I did in the old days. But you know something, kid? I'd love to open up another joint again. Why don't you? I've had real estate agents looking for two years. They can't find the right place. Well, if it's just a place you want, that seems pretty easy. No, it's not easy. It's kind of like falling in love. You gotta feel a special attachment, a special… Like you and your friend… Kira. Kira. Hey, why don't you help me look? Maybe you can come up with something. Me? Sure. You've got a good eye. Stranger things have happened. Yeah, I guess they have. Listen, I gotta go. I understand. I'll let myself out? Sure. So long. See you around.

Hey! Oh, I'm sorry. You scared the hell out of me. I'm sorry if I disturbed you. I tried to be quiet. How long you been standing there? Just a few seconds. Should I go? Oh, no, stay. You paint beautifully. This is the first time I've cared about what I've painted in a long time. That's a shame. It must be frustrating to waste your talents on things that don't really matter to you. Yeah. I met a guy the other day. He told me I should take long lunch hours. A guy? Yeah. Someone I met at the beach. He's got this crazy idea he wants to build a club, and he asked me if I'd help him find a place. All the real estate agents in this town, he asks me, right. That's not such a crazy idea. You've got a good eye. That's what he said. If it's a place you want, what about this one? My place, where we met. That? Forget it. I think it has a very special aura about it. It's a dump! You're supposed to be an artist. Use your imagination. Thanks a lot, I'm all out. You know, I really think you believe that. I've had enough for tonight. Come on, let's get out of here. Okay. What's this? Shh, we gotta be quiet. I thought we were going skating. I wanna show you the special studio first. Only the biggest groups get to record here. It's really kind of magic. Mmm? Yeah. They flash all sorts of pictures on screens. Really? Can we see it? Straight ahead. But pictures in a recording studio? Why? For inspiration. Oh, inspiration. Sounds perfect. I've only watched them do this a couple of times before. Let's see… Turn on that one. And this. I don't know how to make the whole thing work. Do everything. Go on. Press them all. I don't wanna break it. Then press them carefully! What the hell. I didn't like the job anyway. Let's see… Now will we see the magic? Sure. Come on.

Our first dance together. Followed by our first being-kicked-out together. Now I want to go somewhere else. Where? Find out more about you. You know enough about me. I wanna know about you. I'm serious. So am I. Well, after all that, do you think you'd let your imagination roam a little? Look, I won't even start in on that one. What are you doing? - What do you think you're doing? - Oh, nothing. Oh. Well, well, well. Now, what a coincidence. Look where we just happened to end up. You think you're real clever, don't you? Well, I just didn't want you to close your eyes to any possibilities. You really think this could work out for Danny? I think this place could be anything you want it to be. See, it's simple. Your friend has a dream, and you want to be involved in something you really believe in. Well, maybe his dream is big enough for the both of you. So here we are. Someone who believes that dreams come easy, and… Someone who doesn't know what they believe in. So just think about it, okay? Just think about it. You gotta be kidding. This place? They used to have wrestling here. So it's got a history of success. It needs some fixing up. I think it could look terrific. So could the Titanic. Kid, you don't need a builder. You need a demolition team. Look, I know it's a wreck now, but I can see it coming to life again. Just check it out, Danny. That's all I'm asking. Well, what put you onto this? A girl. Oh, that explains everything. Hey, Danny, don't you think there's a certain kind of aura about this place? Well, if that's what you call it, it's got it all right. Let's see the rest of it. Of course, it's not small and intimate like my club in New York. But then again, that was back in 1945 and things are bigger now. And this place… Whoo. Sure is big. Yeah, it is. Yeah. Well, I don't know. I don't know. Naturally, I can't take all this too seriously. But if I were going to do something about it, and I can't say I am because, you see, I'm a builder, and a builder has to take his time deciding these things. But if I were going to do something about it, just speaking hypothetically, it just might work. You think so? Might. If I planned it right. Let's see… Stage over there. Stairs there and there and back there. Kid, can you imagine it? Imagine what? A bandstand right over there in that corner. And a big band, like in the '40s. No, no, no. Bandstands went out with running boards. Over there… A great rock and roll band. This is the '80s. Real smooth dancers. Wild trombone. The band decked out in tuxedos. Six guys wearing electric orange. Synthesizer, heavy percussion, electric guitar. Lots of glamor. Everybody dressed in elegance and style. Do it, Daddy, do it. Yeah, man.

I can't take that. Why? I don't know the first thing about being a partner. Well, it's easy. We share the responsibilities and we argue a lot. It's like being married, without the good part. Come on, kid. Is it a deal? Okay. It's a deal. What do you know! I'm back in show business. Now, I can't wait. I gotta look over every inch of this place. I only wish we could see better. I got a flashlight in the car. Will you get it? Yeah. It's our first collaboration as partners. And, oh, partner? Partner, what'll we name the place? Yeah. What the hell to call it? \"In Xanadu did Kubla Khan A stately pleasure-dome decree…\" \"Where Alph, the sacred river, ran \"Through caverns measureless to man \"Down to a sunless sea.\" \"Down to a sunless sea.\" Yes, Xanadu. I'm Kira. Of course. You're Kira. But… But? I mean… Don't I know you? I don't think so. Are you sure because… Because? Well, I mean… I don't know. I was thinking that I… Oh, I'm sorry. Forget it. So, you're gonna do it? Yes, we're gonna do it. Total insanity. Only if you think so. Well, even if it is, it's worth a try. Xanadu. How do you think that'll look on a marquee? - Hmm, wonderful. - Hey! When did you get here? Just a minute ago. What'd I tell you, Danny? One minute she's here, the next minute, who knows? Guess what you own half of, partner. What? Xanadu. Xanadu. Xanadu. Hi, guys. Hey, Picasso. Hey. How you doing? Let's see, what's first on the agenda? - Hey, who are you calling? - Leave a dime on the counter. Hello, Simpson? Sonny Malone. I wanna see you right away. Hey, what's going on here? Who cares what's going on. Just get out before he gets here. Yeah. I'll fix everything up. I'll tell him it was a joke. Hey, wait a minute. Relax. It's okay. Are you loaded? Because, when you sober up, you're gonna be real sorry. He should be coming in just about now. Malone, what the hell is going on? Simpson, I've worked like a dog trying to make Tuesday Wednesday. I couldn't do it. I must be a failure. Is he straight? You told me if I didn't do things the right way, I'd be fired. Well, you were right. Huh? I'm fired! Malone, I want you out of here in five minutes. That's five minutes, Malone, and if it's six, just keep walking. Got it? I'm doing it. I'm doing it. I'm doing it! You know that dream of mine to get out of here? Well, it's happening, and you're all invited. Opening night, whatever you want, it's on the house. You know, I always wanted to say that line. Shit. Okay. To Xanadu. To dreams. I couldn't have done it without you. How is it? Heavenly. You're the one that's heavenly. No, don't. What's the matter? Did I do something? No. You know, I don't know anything about you. Where you live, where you were born. There's nothing to know. Where do you live? With my sisters. Where? In an apartment. Yeah, but where's the apartment? On the second floor. Look, I don't even know how to find you. Yeah, but you always do. Okay. That's a dead end. What's your last name? Same as my father's and mother's. Yeah, but what is it? What? My father's or my mother's? I don't care. Either one. Same as mine. Okay, I get it. No questions. No questions, no lies. No questions, no truth either. Listen, you know enough about me already. Any more, you're gonna get a headache. Are you living with somebody? Yes. I'm living with my sisters. I told you already.

You've made the place look beautiful. Just did What the kid said. Oh, I see a little Danny McGuire here and there. Oh, just here and there. Don't tell anybody, but I'm nervous. What about? Well, I haven't had an opening night since 1945. Wow! I guess I got the jitters. Well, just pretend we're back in 1945 all over again. I don't have to pretend. It is 1945 all over again. Well, that takes care of that. Sonny, don't worry about that sound system. I looked over it twice today and it's fine. You kids go on home. Bye, Danny. 1945. You did it. Tomorrow's your big day. It's all gonna come true. Tomorrow's gonna be the most beautiful day in the world. Kira. I love you. I love you, Sonny. What's the matter? All of it, everything. We can't go on pretending this is for real. I know, it is hard to believe. I can't have these kind of feelings. It's beginning to hurt. This part of it was never supposed to happen. I don't understand. What do you mean, \"hurt\"? I know I shouldn't, but I do, and it's crazy. Sonny, there's something I have to tell you about myself. I know all I need to know. No, I have to tell you. I have no choice. All I was sent to do was to make Xanadu happen. I don't get it. Sonny, you have to believe me when I tell you that I never wanted to hurt you. That was the last thing I wanted to happen. I'm not as I appear to you. Have you ever heard the expression, \"Kissed by a muse\"? That's what I am. I'm a muse. I'm glad somebody's having a good time. Please don't make a joke. I'm serious. I come from Mount Helicon. I'm the daughter of Zeus. I have eight sisters. My real name is… Are you telling me that's not real? I'm trying to tell you the truth. Why don't you believe me? Look up the word \"muse\" in the dictionary. Go on. Page 728. Read it. Okay. All right, I'll read it. \"Muse. Any of the nine sister…\" Like the album cover? Hmm. \"Any of the nine sister goddesses in Greek mythology \"presiding over song and poetry and the arts and sciences. \"And do you believe me now, Sonny?\" How'd you do that? What's going on? The television. Well, well, look who's here. Who's chasing you this time, Vargas? The cops? Or the mob? Don't get smart with me, Nick. I told you to stay away from Brenda Trent. Yes, you did tell me. What should I do, Sonny? Dive at him or make a martini? - What'? - Who you talking to? Sonny Malone. He doesn't believe Kira's a muse. How can you be talking to me? You're a movie. I ain't got time for this, Malone. Brenda's the only one that saw me at the racetrack. Now if the lady says she's a muse, she's a muse. Who's that? Brenda! Kira. Sonny. I think he needs a drink. It's okay. I'll take care of it. Thanks. Good luck on the opening of your joint, kid. Wish I could be there. Oh, wow! Oh, Sonny. We've been painted by Michelangelo. Shakespeare's written sonnets about us. Beethoven's played music for us. We're not supposed to feel emotion or show any feelings. Muses are just supposed to inspire. I fell in love. You did? Well, what do you think happened to me? It was a mistake. I broke the rules. Well, now what the hell do we do, huh? Answer that, muse! I don't know. I'm sorry. It just never should have happened. Well, it did. I love you, Sonny. Kira. I'll love you forever. I Will. I'll love you forever. Kira! Wait! I'll love you forever. Hey, painter! I've been looking for you. Where you been? Here. Well, how do I look? Aren't you gonna say anything about my new threads? Hubba, hubba. Well, we're gonna miss you tonight. It won't be any fun without you. I told you. I can't go. Xanadu doesn't matter anymore. What do you mean, it doesn't matter? How can it not matter? This was our dream. Well, wasn't it? There's no Xanadu 'cause there's no Kira. She made it real. So find her! Bring her back! Dreams die. No. No, no, no. Not by themselves. We kill them. Now, if you give up, you'll be sitting on that rock 30 years from now, just like I was. I know how you feel, kid. I felt the same way once. I did. I didn't know how important love is. But let me tell you something. Somehow, somewhere, there's a way to get her!

Sonny. How did you get here? You didn't think I'd let you get away from me, did you? You'll have to go back. Okay, I'm ready. Let's go. I can't go with you, but you have to get out before it's too late. Too late for what? Oh, please, you took a big chance coming here. What's going on here? I'm taking you back with me, Kira. It can't be done. Nobody's ever taken anyone out of here. Not in the whole history of… The whole history. I'll make them let you go. Hey, Zeus! Zeus, you hear me? Oh, God. I wanna talk to you. We don't use those old-fashioned names anymore. In any case, it's me you want to speak to. I've come to get Kira. She's not leaving! It's impossible! That's what you think. That's what you think. How'd you know I was gonna say that? Put it this way. I'm a good guesser. What else do you know? Everything. All right, then. You know this. I'm sticking to this place till hell freezes over. Sonny! You'll leave now and you'll leave without Kira! Why? Because other people have dreams. So send another muse. You got muses running around all over the place. One dream, one muse. Wait… Wait a minute. Just listen to me, okay? Kira and I love each other. Now I don't know how often that happens in this kind of place, but back on Earth, it's pretty rare. We need to be together. All right, that's enough. You're leaving. Kira's staying. No more discussions. Those are the rules and that's all there is to it. On the other hand, dear, rules were made to be broken. We'll talk about that later. Which is later and which is earlier? - I keep forgetting. - Just a minute! Isn't anyone interested in my feelings? What do you mean, \"feelings\"? Oh, you remember, pet. We learnt about feelings in our mortal history class. Yes, feelings. I guess that's what you call them. I've never really had them before. I've never felt this way about anyone before. And I've never asked to leave here. Not ever. Not once in the whole time I've been here. No, it's true, dear, she hasn't. Not in all these centuries. Or is it minutes? I do keep mixing them up. Please, can't we just have this one night? Just one night? No, no, it's just not possible. Goodbye, Sonny Malone. Hey, Kira? Just one moment? Goodbye, Sonny.

{"title": "X&Y (2018) - full transcript", "plot": "An artist has chosen a famous male actor for them together, in the context of a feature film, to deconstruct themselves and their invading roles. They engage in a boundless play with their ...", "transcript": "foodval.com - stop by if you're interested in the nutritional composition of food   ---  \n        It was a large room, full of people. All kinds. And all arrived at the same building at more or less at the same time. And they were all free. And they were all asking themselves the same question. What is behind that curtain ? Are you alright ? Yes. I'd say so. If you were an animal, which animal would best represent you ? A coyote. \n \n \n \n    (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n \n And what animal would I be ? I suppose you could be a small wolf bitch. And why do I think that ? Is that because if both of us were wolves, would that... Would that be some kind of compliment ? Or would it be because you have the role you have, here and now ? I don't know. Do you think there's a difference in being a woman, sexually, in the sense of receiving, or being filled up ? As opposed to being a man... And filling up ? Definitely. I'd say there's quite a big difference. But that is the way it is. What way ? - Things are much easier for us men. - How come ? \n \n \n \n    (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n \n I mean, if either of us didn't want to have sex, and I was the woman, I'd find that situation much easier to understand. Then, that's a kind of intrusion. Whereas if I'm the man, I might think, \"What's the problem ? Pants down, it'll be over in two seconds. What's the problem ?\" So, you're happy to be a man ? In that sense, I'm very happy to be a particularly manly man. I have no thoughts whatsoever of being filled up. Being a woman would be difficult ? That particular aspect of female sexuality involves certain elements I'd find very tricky to deal with. Actually, the producer bought me a strap-on when I said I ought to practise the male fucking motion. - Hang on ! Did you tell him that ? - Yes. I explained I needed one to understand what it's like to possess someone else. Didn't that get totally weird ? Yes, but isn't it very exciting that he's actually agreed to be fucked with a strap-on ? - What ? Did he really say that ? - Yes. Watch this. Interesting. If you wanted to use that on me, you'd have to be gentle. Are you serious ? Well... Let's put it like this... We entered into this project together. All in. We don't want any half-measures. I want to examine the concept of identity and what it means to be a human being. As an artist, I will, together with actor Mikael Persbrandt, live in a studio for periods of time. I want us to be able to work uninterrupted and unaffected by any external factors. We will examine both the internal and the external views of ourselves. The idea is to reach beyond the media pictures of us and find out who we really are. In the studio, we have set up an interrogation room where we will be seeking the absolute truth. Mikael and I will assign different actors the roles of our alter egos. They will portray different sides of us. Through them, we will be able to shed some light on who we have been, who we currently are and who we'd like to be. We have also built two consulting rooms where Mikael and I will meet our individual psychologists to process what happens in the studio. All our work will result in a feature film. The idea is that the script for this film will take shape gradually, based on the work we do together in the studio. I will write the script when we're not living in the studio. What's really great is that no one outside the project will ever know what's real and what's fiction. X&Y Are you attracted to me ? I'll tell you what I felt like before you got here, okay ? - No. - The external view. Why would that be okay ? I asked if you're attracted to me. I think both men and women get turned on by you. I don't know what you're on about. I asked you if you're attracted to me. Looking at the medial picture, I feel aggressively turned on. I also feel... angry. But even that is kind of playful. - Are you attracted to me ? - Yes, I'm attracted to you. I could do anything right now... Me too. I could have sex here and now. Me too. Okay... How would we set about it ? Show me. What would you do ? I'm not quite sure... What would I do ? You would... No, it's good like this. Don't you think we should save it for later ? I don't know. We've never felt one another. Now, we can. The good thing is that we can do it for real. But no one else will know it's for real. I don't want to leave here. There was a lot of talk about sex. I haven't heard you talk about it before. Maybe I haven't spoken about it, but it's a really important part of our identity and of being human. Well, maybe I'm the only one who doesn't get this single-minded focus... - No. It's not hugely interesting. - Look at it this way: Being the alpha male he is, it's a really important part of the picture. To me, the most important thing is you focusing on the total picture. Like you... writing a script. Listen, you won't find anyone willing to finance a film that's this unstructured. But the investigation has just started. I can't just make up the whole film ! I've been clear from the start: my work is explorative. Research, script writing and filming happen side by side. That's super, Anna... Mikael and I are known for crossing boundaries. I want to challenge the alpha male that's him. I want to record two sex scenes. One where he penetrates me, for real, and another one where I penetrate him. - That wolf scene... What's the point ? - I'll talk you through it. Mikael and I meet in a forest glade at dusk. I've got some wolf costumes I've made. I tell him I'll teach him to understand his inner animal. We undress and get into these costumes. And Mikael reacts to the fact that his genitals are uncovered. But I calmly tell him that wolves worry about totally different things. We get down on all fours and I start telling him how wolves behave. He's a bit stiff and questioning, but when I put my hand between my legs and then caress his face with it... Then, he takes me from behind, on all fours. - Hello ? - Hi ! - Were you sleeping ? - No, I was working on the costumes. Hey, I'm just calling to tell you something. I'm not saying we definitely do, but we may have a problem. Mikael's agent called and said Mikael mustn't have real sex. He's told his agents ? Yes, he's told them you want him to mount you when you're dressed as wolves, and you want to use a strap-on on him. So, he's told them, and that means those scenes are out ? I mean, they haven't banned sex scenes. Just penetration. - Ordinary film sex is fine. - What ? They're banning penetration to protect him. If you have sex, he might go back to abusing drugs again. - Okay. - I suppose he's got another life now. - They do this to protect him. - Protect him against me ? Honestly, Anna, I don't know. All I wanted was to... - To tell you this. - Okay, right. Bye. Oh, well... - Josefin. Scenographer. - Micke. - Hi, I'm Emelie. I'll be dressing you. - Hi, Emelie. - I'm Anders. Production assistant. - Nice to meet you, Anders. So, this is part of the team. Now, I'll show you your room. - Right. - Okay. - You can check it out. - Alright - you first. Exciting, eh ? Nice ! We can lose those. I don't understand that thing. Remove that, too. Oh, well - it's really nice. You'll be sleeping in here with all your alter egos. Maybe you wonder why I'm here ? I'd like to find out what your intention is. I set two criteria for any project I enter into. First of all, it must have exceptional artistic ambitions. Secondly, there has to be a realistic possibility of realising these exceptional, high-quality artistic ambitions. What do you want this to result in ? A bloody good film, quite simply. Is he really interested in finding out who he is or will he be playing a role? I'll never know, but he seems interested. How do you see the fact that I can consider having sex with him on camera? Well... That way, you get control over this sexual relationship. Moreover, you get to pick a man many women will envy you having got into bed. Envy you winning that conquest, I mean. But in that case, I could simply pretend we're having sex. I suspect you're more complicated than that. I don't think you want to pretend, as your ambition is to investigate reality. When I think of you, a line comes to mind: \"God's bravest angel.\" It's all about pushing right up to the limits. Even pushing past them, to reach what's beyond the human form, where you become a brave angel. A human being through whom God can be perceived. How would you describe an alpha male ? To me, the expression narcissist is more dynamic. In my view, a narcissist carries a self-loathing of enormous proportions which can only be overcome when he receives constant admiration and love from others. Is there a female version of the alpha male ? You could say there are two. One is the woman who consumes the man. Kills him after having used him. The female spider. Then, there's the one who's obsessed by the man and would never criticise him. As long as she gets the sex she wants, that's enough. A wonderful situation for the man. - It reinforces his dream of being... - An alpha male ? Anna uses these cliched images when she talks about my person. Like \"alpha male\" ! What the fuck is that ? I've spent my whole life struggling to maintain a sensitive... Struggling to survive with this over-sensitive soul. Are you troubled by the fact that she doesn't see your soft side ? - Yes. - I knew it. - That troubles me. - Yes. What the hell's an alpha male ? Really ? What ? As if I was some kind of fucking animal, eh ? - Hi ! - Welcome. - I'm Mikael. - Sofie. - Anna. - Sofie. I'll start by asking you to tell us: who's the character you'll be playing ? Based on what you know. Well, I don't really know who you are. Or I know very little about you. But I can tell what... What do you know about your character ? I know she or you suffered from mental illness when you were young. You're someone who can fall apart. What escapist behaviour do you have ? Drugs, alcohol... Conquests. Sex. Alcohol. Drugs. Conquests. Power. Sex. You are Mikael Persbrandt. You started off as a dancer, but went into acting. You have a long career behind you. You cross boundaries. You're destructive, and that affects a lot of people. I think that in your life, you're battling against different things you believe you have to live up to. I wish I would suffer less. You suffer a lot ? I feel I do. I wish I would suffer less. You suffer a lot ? - I feel I do. - Give me an example. I feel angst about my compulsion to adapt. Having to fit a template gives me angst. Are you lacking anything in yourself ? Yes, indeed. Many things. Like what ? Patience. Calmness. Clear-headedness. A context. How far could you go as an actress ? Actually, I think I could go all the way. I could do anything for art. It's like, when I'm on, I'm on. I'm not frightened. I do what it takes. - Sounds good. - Yes. Anything for art is great. - Okay, welcome ! - Thanks. This way. Is that my place ? No. Mikael and Anna will show you later where you'll be living. First, we're going in here. Here they are. - Hello ! - Hi. Hello. - Is everything good ? - Yes. - Really good. - Great. This got off on such a wrong bloody start. You were meant to be six alter egos, and here we only have four. Okay. That's... a shame. - Some producer fucked things up. - To say the least ! - Sofie and Shanti will be here soon. - It'll be fine. - Are we going back home then ? - Not at all. We'll start off like this, and they'll join us in a few days. Why don't the four of us just get going ? - That'll work. - Great. Here, we've got your character descriptions. - Can we have something to drink ? - Sure, feel free. - Thanks. - You don't drink juice. There. - Vera ? - You drink water. - Okay. - There you go. - Can I have some water ? - Sure, I'll pour you some. We've got... - Thanks. - You're welcome. As of now, you will be in character, constantly. Okay. And you'll take turns in telling us who you are. - Why don't you start, Trine. - Introduce yourself. I'm Trine Dyrholm, and I'm depicting the artistic, intelligent side of Mikael that sometimes crosses lines. - Good. - That's me. I'm Thure Lindhardt, and I'm doing Mikael's destructive side. According to some people. - Right. Vera ? - My name's Vera Vitali. I'm playing Anna's expressive, extrovert or somewhat provocative... Her provocative alter ego. I like challenging people I meet. - Exciting. - Yes, it is exciting. So, you cross boundaries, you explore things and you're provocative ? Tell us about you, Jens. Yes, go on, Jens. My name's Jens Albinus, and I'm a little scared... No, not scared, but I'm playing Anna's alter ego. The alter ego that's a bit scared. Scared that... And very uncertain that I'll be adequate enough. And possibly a slight fear of being a little boring. It'll be great. - We've got iPods for you. - With music for each character. - This is mine. - And for Thure. Jens gets gold. And remember that now you are working, and as of now... You are your characters. All the time. Yes. - One can easily get scared by you. - Why's that ? This is the second time you tell us we have to be in character. - Obviously, we're here to work. - That's what I mean. Well done, Jens. I think this will be grand. - This is it. - Wow ! - It's a bit messy, but... - It's beautiful ! I've been working a lot on these costumes. This place is awesome. - This is it. Please come in. - Yes, that'll work. - Nice ? - Amazing bed. - Nice. - I assume I'm in the middle. - Of course, if you want to. - Come on ! Hold your horses. - But what... Can't you... Why is fucking Mikael so important ? We like the challenge, and the playfulness. Life is so very hard. And if you play a little, that kind of makes it bearable. That's true, actually. Are we frightened ? As long as he's in on it, it's one hundred percent exciting. - See ! He's taken a territorial piss ! - Better now ? Hey ! Close that door behind you. - Is that my shirt ? - Which one ? - Mikael, are these mine ? - No, mine. Those are mine ! - Those are yours. The button-downs. - So, these are mine ? Can I see ? Are these mine, then ? I say ! Look ! You'd look a sight in this one ! - Shut up ! What do you know ? - Guys. Guys ! - Hey ! - What ? - Alright. Cheers ! Welcome ! - No, I don't... Hey, you two ! Could you please calm down a little ? - Okay. Where's the minibar ? - We haven't started yet. No minibar. - What did you say ? - There's no minibar. It's gone. - So, where's the alcohol ? Any vodka ? - There's no alcohol. - Are you serious ? - It's gone. Dried up. - Any drugs ? - Let's just buy something. Quit it. - Good joke. - It's no joke. - What do you mean ? - You want to snort a line ? - Whatever. We're portraying you ! - Trine, shut up ! - We're playing you ! - Put the glasses down ! Are you pissed off now ? Isn't the whole point finding out how far we can push him in this study ? How far he will go ? If we fuck Mikael, we rule him. That gives us the power. Yes. Nevertheless, if he wants to shag us... If Mikael Persbrandt wants to shag us, then maybe we aren't all that gross ? Maybe he'll even fall in love ? So, is this the concept of fucking the king of men ? Well, I mean... Part of it. All of that is part of this project. Okay. So, seeing this sex thing purely from a technical perspective, is it important to us that he's clean ? - I'd emphasise handsome. - Our goal is to go into this. That means we don't try to work things out in advance. We go with the flow. Right. - Why not tell us why it says FUCK ? - Give me a break ! - Alright ! Sure ! - Fuck ? Fuck ! Why the hell would anyone write fuck on their hand ? These are my war marks ! That's just how it was. - How ? - Quit it ! You want me to tell you ? - Yes. Tell us. - I don't want to tell you. - It's part of the project ! - It's my life ! If we're to work with you, you need to tell us stuff. When you've been in for 337 days a tattooist rolls up on methadone, very slow. I get annoyed with him, tell him to fuck off and leave his machine. And then I take the wire connected to the machine. Two wires which I intertwine while looking for a connection. So I tear down the kitchen light, connect those wires up, and then I connect that to a plug on the end of some fucking lead. And trying to use my left toe to switch it on, the machine jumps into life. People would say: \"Never do it yourself. And not your hands.\" Oh, your hands ? You did it yourself on your hands ? He did it himself ! Wow ! Damn... Let's play rock, paper, scissors and see who gets tattooed. One, two, three ! Best of three, eh ? Three, two, one, now ! Three, two, one, now ! No ! That's so frustrating ! Don't worry, no one will hear us here. Come on, come here. No... What are you thinking ? I only wanted a bit of fun. Isn't that what you want, too ? Go to bed. - And you... - Sorry. - I haven't forgotten. - Hello there ! - Hi. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to... - Good night. Goddammit ! Oh, two shoes. - Was it fun ? - Yes. - She was completely wild. - But you were not wild at all ? - Nope. - You're in no state to get it up. Nope. But it's no big deal, really. - Were you both coming to bed here ? - No, not really. - Were you going to... - Just come to bed. - Right ! - What ? Come on. Come on up, now. - There. - I'm too pissed. And your fly is open, too. I had a strong feeling yesterday, when I was about to tell you about my tattoos. I felt so fucking stupid. Because... Somehow... I would stage the mistakes I've made in life as a joke. I felt so incredibly ill at ease when I had to tell you about those tattoos. Because... this is... This is me. That's me. Get it ? That. All of that, that's my life. - Do you get what I mean ? - Yes. It's not exactly what I was told, but... Oops. - That's too much, isn't it ? - Yes. - But if we actually wanted to eat it ? - Some has to go. But we don't want to appear weird, so we need to be a bit careful so people don't notice what we're up to. - Take the slice of cheese on top. - Okay. - Fold it so it gets a bit more solid. - Okay. - Let's move that. It's way too much. - Oh dear. Sure. - More like this ? - Exactly. Just like that. If we're going to eat, we want it... Food is a kind of poison, so... If we're indulging in it, we want it to be tasty so you need more butter there. We don't want people to see. We have no serviette. It mustn't look strange with all this cheese everywhere. - Okay. - So... When no one's looking, we have to... If you're eating together with others, you can just... - Like that. - Okay. And that's too much cheese. - Right ! Slept well ? - Yes, like a log. This food's a bit tedious, but there's at least nothing wrong with it. - Jens ? Are you afraid of germs ? - Me ? No, no. For today's exercise Shanti will also be turning up. - How nice. - Great ! Shanti's good. He's perfect ! You don't need to be scared of me. Deep inside me, there's a scared little boy. And when I look at you, I see myself. Do you understand ? I see your fear. That's my fear, too. You're so very beautiful ! - I don't know if I... - What ? What don't you know ? - If you're mocking me. - Why would I be mocking you ? Jens, in this situation you wouldn't dare look straight into Michael's eyes. You want to be close, but you're afraid he'll see that you aren't beautiful. - That I'm disgusting, even ? - Yes. You're petrified he'll just feel repulsed. And my goal, is that still... What is my goal ? - You want recognition. - I want recognition. I want recognition, too. What I'd actually love is for you to give me recognition. Could you change places ? Then, let's see if you can give me some recognition. Why don't we start with you giving me a compliment ? Just like that ? - Vera ? - Stop wriggling out of things. - I'd like Vera... - You're not great at compliments, eh ? Vera, this is yours... Hi. You... have an attractive force that's bloody amazing. You're also very sexy. And a little dangerous. I like that. No. No, this... I'd like Shanti to do this. The more reflective side of me. Yeah. How does it feel ? Actually... Mikael ? I need some help with this. I need a script. Think of what we're good at. What you like. Then go for it ! \"For women, love is more than appetite A sensation of the tongue more than the heart That appetite may sicken from excess But mine is no less voracious than the sea And melts the same, so don't compare The feeling a woman may have for me With the feeling I harbour for you.\" That's one way of doing it. So, what else do you like ? In your own words. Coming from you. Okay. No, I really think I need a script. Just say: \"First, there's Thalia. Then, there's my wife.\" - \"First, there's Thalia.\" - \"Then, there's my wife.\" - \"Then, there's my wife.\" - It's an exercise ! Could you just focus on me ? To hell with Thalia. - In what ways do you feel loved ? - You know... People think I only want one thing, but I'm actually interested in women's inner lives. - Sex isn't everything. - And I know that. I know you have these two sides, and that's why I like you, but... - Your depth just isn't as... - I'd like to paint you. - Now. - Okay. How would you like me to sit ? Or lie ? - Like this ? - Lie any way you want. I think this is where Thure steps in. Hi. Thure, pull Vera closer. Closer. And Vera, you keep complimenting him. You've got the most beautiful eyes. You're beautiful throughout. Thure, now you caress Vera's breasts. Vera, take your hand and place it on Thure's dick. Thure ? Unbutton your trousers. Then, you softly press Vera's face against your dick. What the fuck ? What the fuck's happening ? I just felt a bit queasy. It's... Is it because of us ? Are you sabotaging this on purpose, or what ? I've never felt ill from that. At least not while it's happening. God, how unprofessional can you get ? Jens ? - Now I can't continue. Can you ? - He's okay. Who gives a fuck ? - He is, though. - Sabotaging a scene is unprofessional. - We're trying to focus on our job ! - Something caught in his throat. - Well, I'm trying to work here ! - Is it... Yeah ! Fucking amateur ! So, you knew that ? So, why do we need sex in all of this ? Why are you so set on fucking ? There's actually something I'd like to say, if that's alright ? - Please do. - It's about you, Trine. I can see that when you're sitting there broaching the topic of fucking, you start leering. That makes me want to tell you that we've agreed to keep within certain boundaries and stay in character. - Unbelievable ! - What is ? Hell, I work the way I work ! - Do you really ? - Yes ! I'm always in character ! - I'm here to work. Or, we all are. - Yes. Exactly ! And then, if I'm honest, I think it's crap that you can't do your job ! - For fuck's sake ! - Are you pissed off ? Why do you suddenly play cop ? That's totally not in character. And my verdict is that this is totally in line. Well, this is also totally in line, so who's out of order ? So, what's it like, working with me ? Honestly, now. -Well, I... I like it. - Oh ? - What's your feeling ? - I don't know. Yes, I like it, too. - You do ? - Yes. - That's great. - But... I don't mean but, but... Wouldn't it be good if we were totally honest with one another ? - Yes. - And then... Well... Okay, I would... I love children. I love being close to children. - I think it's... - Okay ? And... Well, I'm feeling a bit panicky. I'm a bit stressed. I mean, I have loads of dates. I sleep with loads. But then, I get bored and then I leave. I leave relationships because it just gets too... boring. Do you get me ? But I want children. I do want a child. Okay. So, I was thinking that... Maybe you and I could have a baby ? A kind of... - As part of this film. Naturally. - Of course. Yeah. - You mean... ? - Sure. - I'm in. - It would be an art baby. - Yes. - And I would have a child. - Sure. - I'd be so happy. Count on me. Hang on, are you really... Do you get... ? - Do you get what I mean ? - Definitely. - So, how were you picturing it ? - Well, kind of... - If... - We'd have to... - Seriously. What's your idea ? - Seriously, we'll have to... I assume we'd start by seducing one another. Wouldn't we ? - How does that sound ? - That sounds smart. - Really smart. - Let's do it for real. Okay. And how do you envisage the outcome ? For you, in your private life ? At home ? - What would your wife say ? - But... I'm not really sure that I've made any kind of realistic analysis of the consequences. I can't claim that. No, I can kind of tell. I can tell, so... - I'm actually serious. - So am I. No. You're acting. No. This is reality. So, you take no responsibility for reality outside of here ? This is reality. We're playing with reality and fiction. You're an artist. I'm an artist. The ultimate combination of you and me is to have a child. An art baby. Hang on ! I don't really know if I... You're talking about the film ? If so, I'm all in. I thought you were saying that you wanted a baby with me in real life ? - Yes. - You want to have a baby with me ? Do you want a baby with Mikael Persbrandt ? Yes... Or, I mean... My thoughts were... Of course, I can't sit here, as the director, and ask you to impregnate me. So, you don't want a baby with me ? - I do want a baby. - You want a baby ? But I am... I thought that since we're playing with reality and fiction anyway, why don't we just play with that idea, too ? This baby will be an art baby, so when I care for it, I'll be making art. Hang on, I really need to ask you: Is this something that happens in the film ? Or are we talking about your private life ? - In the film... - Right now, we're working. - Then, it's a great idea. - Yes ? I seem to keep misunderstanding you. I kept thinking that you actually wanted to have a baby with me. Or even worse, with Mikael Persbrandt. - No, what I'm imagining is... - You don't want a baby with me ? - I wouldn't say no. - You want a baby with me ? No ? Yes ? She wants to have an art baby with me ! - An art baby ? - Yeah. We'll have sex, make a baby. For real. In this film. At least within the framework of the film, but still a real child. Just imagine her coming to you ! - No thanks. - What would your reaction be ? I really don't know. I don't know how to... Do you feel a sense of responsibility ? - That's the one ! - Mikael ? Can I ask you, Mikael: What happens if you just have one small drink ? I feel no need to do that. Why do you ask ? - Just curious. - Do you find it provocative ? Well, I for one find it a fucking shame when someone can't even have one glass. Anna, it's wonderful that you're in such a good mood. Tell us more about your methods. When will we start filming ? I want to know that, too. When will we start ? - You know what we're doing, don't you? - Yes, but I've been in loads of films. And a production plan is always a great thing. - Oh, leave her alone. - Don't worry about them. We're meant to be having fun, and that includes you. Thanks for tonight. Okay, I'm off to my room. Know that I'm with you all the way, no holds barred. I'll do whatever the fuck you want me to do. Can you grab that ? Right, now Christmas can come again ! - Bloody hell ! - Damnation ! - Do you know what that was ? A shock ! - Did it hurt ? - Lie there. - Okay. - But, hey... - A cushion ? Sure. I'll get you one. No, that's too fast. No, lie still. Don't move ! I'm doing that massive dick I wanted to do. There. - What's it like ? - Nice ! - Thanks ! Thank you, Mikael. - My pleasure. I'd like to start by welcoming our new alter egos. Shanti, you were around earlier, but an extra warm welcome to Sofie. Why don't you start with a brief introduction ? I'm Sofie Gråbøl, and I'm portraying Anna's logical and artistic side. - And intelligent. - And intelligent. Wasn't that obvious? My name's Shanti Roney, and... I'm playing Mikael's... creative and theatre-loving side. I'd even like to claim that the theatre saved my life. Yes. - Nice. - Cheers. - Enjoy ! And see you ! - Cheers. Cheers. Thure ? I heard things got a bit wild last night. Anna and Thure tattooed one another. - Seriously ? - Show us. Nothing big... War marks ! This is nice. I mean, I made it. - No... Cheers ! - Let's drink to tattoos ! Cheers, Mikael ! Right, now when we're all gathered, I feel it's a good time to ask... Anna ? What are we doing here ? What is it we are doing ? This is yours. As you know, the thing we're trying to shed some light on here is who we are. Who we have been, and who we'd love to be. We're trying to reach the most essential part of being a human being. Go on. And since we are all artists, we possess enormous potential to actually manage to create something totally amazing in here. We can permit ourselves to create a strong, artistic and provocative film. You never were a present dad 'cause you never could overcome your own angst. But that wasn't the only reason I distanced myself from you. I don't think mum's family ever gave you a chance. And grandma, apparently a good person, was scared of all things different. She made the rest of the family shut you out. Even resent you. When I was little, you were a great man. You were so great, and I so wanted to be that great man. I wanted to be that person who could just leave his family because he found someone even better. Fuck ! I don't even know why I'm here. I don't even know where I am. Maybe all I needed was to see how small you really are, and I see that now. You are so small. I've always felt the lack of a father. Like a vast hole inside. Constantly looking for recognition. I can't really say that I've been that present in my own children's lives. But now, I am trying to be. Now, I'm doing my best. Do you remember calling me a whore ? I'd just been up to see my brother who was ill, and... You stopped the car when you saw me walking from the hospital. You lowered the window, told me I looked like a whore, raised it and drove off. Do you know why I wore so much make-up that I looked like a whore ? I couldn't cope with the fact that I looked like you. For years, I was obsessed with the idea that you should die. I had decided I was going to kill you. I checked out rifle clubs to get access to a weapon. But I never got that far. I ended up in a mental ward. Sure, it would have been easier for me if I had refrained from protesting so hard against your weird ideas about order. I don't get it. Is she saying that... If we'd behaved differently, he would have, too ? Is she blaming us ? She's probably thinking that he'll be able to accept his part of the blame if she helps him carry it. Should a child carry the blame for a parent who can't control his temper ? - No. Sit down. Sit down ! - \"It was a huge mistake. That I was born human. The way things are, I will always be a stranger, incapable of feeling I belong in any group or community. Someone who always has to be somewhat in love with death.\" Dad, a friend of mum's said they saw you in the audience once. When I was performing at the Royal Dramatic Theatre. I wish you'd told me what you thought. I know I was bloody good. Hello ! Do you think you can lie there and hide because you're ill ? No need to answer because you're ill ? Is that your excuse ? I really just want us to talk to one another. Just say something. I really need it ! Have you ever loved me ? Have you ? How could you accuse mum of spoiling us with too much love ? Did you love me like your other family ? A child can never have too much love. I'd never, ever do what you have done to me ! Why are we doing this ? Well ? What's it good for ? Surely this can't be part of the film ? Anna ! Could you come ? We want to ask something. - Anna ? - Anna ! Yes ? What is this ? I felt both you and I have been affected by our relationships with our dads and that they are important in having shaped us as we are today. But surely you understand that we can't include this in the film ? I think it's best to stay with yourselves rather than look at your families. Exposing them can be pretty aggressive. But Mikael, we'd never include anything you can't actually stand for. - Nothing we can't stand for ? - Exactly. I see. Then, why is this in it ? You're criticising my methods in front of the other actors. Not at all ! We've arrived at these methods together. Maybe we have, but I still don't get... - Vera ? Thure ? Could you come in ? - Great ! Bring them in, too. You and I went into this project, fully prepared to bare ourselves. But hell knows if you actually have any depth. I suspect you don't. All there is, is... Attitude. Nothing else. When we started this project, you were large. Grandiose. You were interesting! - Do you know what they say about you ? - No, tell me. - That you're mad. - I'm mad ? - You are ! You're insane. - Insane ? Do you know... Vera ? You're oppressing me. And I know why. - You have to... - You're afraid of me now, aren't you ? - Does it look that way ? - Hey ? Are you ? Are you afraid ? - We're alone here. No one else. - That's got nothing... - You're so fucking empty ! - What does that do to you ? You're so fucking... So fucking... - This is up. - Okay. I can do... - So, you know how this is done ? - I think it has to go like this. Have you done this before ? Lots of times ? Okay. - I think you're amazing. - It's working ? Wait, wait... Fuck, Micke... We were just testing the wolf costumes. Mikael wants you in the interrogation room. Sit down. Right. So, what do you want ? That's what we want to ask you. What's your objective with this project ? You couldn't ask that yourself ? Everyone in here is asking the same thing. Why not tell us what kind of a film you want, and what you want from us ? I want to tell you that I think we have a problem. - Vera, you don't see me. At all. - Sorry ? You hardly speak to me. You seem to pretend I don't exist. - For me to cope, you have to see me. - I see you. I do see you, Jens, in that way we look at our shameful selves. I see what I can stomach. Maybe I can't stand looking all the time. Your only focus is trying to make an impression on Micke and the team. - But you're a part of us ! - So, that's it ? You think I'm too greedy. I take too much space ? What if it's the other way around ? What if that's you ? You drain every sense of life out of us. Could you just try and see him ? Otherwise, Jens' neurotic side will return, grow and take over completely. We have to recognise the useless, ugly aspects of ourselves, too. That's exactly what I mean. The less you see me, the more the problems will grow. But Jens, Vera is really struggling to keep us up. Precisely. Support her in her search for pleasure. Everything can't be 100 per cent correct all the time. I work with uncertainty. And I don't. Sure, an actor can use his uncertainty. All he needs to know is for what. We need something to refer to. If you could let go, embrace this and challenge yourselves, we'd have a... - \"The script is coming.\" - You need one, don't you ? I need a script ! To enable you not to just be a copy-cat. If you hadn't been so scared of trying a different method, we'd have got a hell of a lot further. - Yeah... - And then, this thing with the eyes. You do it all the time. It does add... To the feeling that you're mad. She can't help what she looks like, for fuck's sake ! I think your eyes are nice. Shanti, we're the same person. - On the same side. - All of us are on the same side. She's leaving. That's your fault. Hey, you've gone to bed without me ? - We can't wait for you all night. - You left me on my own out there. You could have asked us to come. We're not mind-readers. Come on. Not many people have such cushy lives that they're paid to sleep. That would be those who work in care homes, maybe. What's that supposed to mean ? You're supposed to carry my self-loathing, not rub me in it. - What ? I don't understand. - You're calling this a madhouse. No, I only said that people working in care homes get paid to sleep. Sensitive as a steam roller. God - when he finally says something almost funny. - Put the light out ! - Do you think I had fun with them ? Anna, just get to bed and sleep. I have to talk to you. - To me ? - Oh, my God, let's leave. - Bye ! - Good luck. Being totally honest... Shouldn't I, or any of the other alter egos, be a little more nuanced ? I feel we just become one huge ego. With Shanti somewhere on a limb. I honestly can't see him in you. Your soft, reflective side simply isn't credible. I can see you in what Thure and I do, but how can Shanti get even a chance with nothing real to go on ? I think he's doing a good job. I think he's lurching around like a blind man. He defended Anna. That was real. Why are you even in this film ? I'd love to know. - I think it'll be a bloody good one. - How the hell can it be ? You aren't giving your alter egos what they need to do your deconstruction ! Maybe Anna's correct ? Maybe it's not about her at all. - You're in this to clear your name. - Shut up. This is wrong ! Your job is to stick to the analysis and the constructive part. - Get it ? - Oh, I do. I'm being you. I'm you and nothing else all the time. Okay, but I don't recognise myself. What a laugh ! You don't see you in me ? No. Well, fuck me ! - I see myself more in Shanti. - Can I say something ? Self-awareness. Yes... I feel like masturbating. This suddenly became very interesting. Okay... Stop that, for fuck's sake ! There's nothing in my contract about having to take part in sexual games. That crossed her limits. I always thought you were bloody rigid. This is a fucking violation ! You don't respect any boundaries at all ! Artistic boundaries don't exist. Blocked people do and in abundance in here. Do you know what your problem is ? An inability to distinguish between no limits and art. Show me your amazing fucking genius ! The sole reason why we're all here. That which is the artist I was under the impression I'd be playing ! Good morning. Hello. Where's Anna ? -She's maybe a bit upset. - And perhaps also a bit oversensitive. - Has something happened ? - Has something happened ? Is there any meaningful communication between you and your director ? - Of course. - Yes, that's pretty obvious. And you have no idea of what's happening ? Indeed. Yesterday, she said she'd got first-rate material and can finalise the script. Finalise ? Or start writing it ? Or what ? I think it has been very interesting being part of this unusual project, but it is of the utmost importance that we, in time, before the next stint... That we get access to a script well before that time. Anna ? As an actor, I need one to be able to deliver. I think that you and Sofie, who came into the process a little late, haven't quite understood how I work. Sorry to ask, but is this an assessment ? Can I say what I want ? Then, I'd like to say, as Jens... The first thing Mikael and I said when you moved into this studio was that in here, you never step out of character. He has to be allowed to say how he feels. You obviously haven't understood at all what we've agreed to do in here ? No worries. It was only a question. Our Danish participants have a plane to catch, so quickly, before you leave... Thank you. Thanks. There she goes. Thank you for being amazingly brave and throwing yourselves into this rather unique project with your hearts, souls and with all your competence. Many thanks. You'll get a script, like you asked for, Shanti. In good time before next time. - In two months' time. - Okay. I've just spoken to Sofie's agent who maintains that Sofie won't be back. Doesn't our agreement require her to come back ? After what happened that last night, we're not in a position to argue. For heaven's sake ! If we report her for breach of contract, they'll sue you for sexual harassment and unwanted sexual advances. How huge a creative block is it possible to exhibit ? All I did was explore my sexual frustration. But Sofie perceived it differently. Think about it, though. Wouldn't it be exciting from a marketing perspective: \"Artist reported for sexually harassing herself.\" Anna, how's the script coming along ? I need a room in the studio to finish the script in. - You promised to have it done. - It's only for one single scene. Use one of the psychologist's rooms. - Hello ? -Were you sleeping ? No. Or yes. Do you know what time it is ? I've decided that I want your reactions to the script to be part of the film. - Anna... - You get it once we're in the studio. Seriously, we need to know what kind of film we're producing. Your mistrust has jeopardised this project. If you'd been less anxious, we wouldn't have had to delay the filming 5 months. You know why there's a 3-month delay. There's no script. It'll be 5 months when we get back. Let's talk about this tomorrow. My family's sleeping. Just go to bed. This script is going to be... Hello ? Peter ? Shit. We're back. - Hello. - Gosh ! - Welcome. - Wow, you've been busy. Hi. - Hi, Trine. - Hi there. - Hi, Jens ! Welcome ! - Hello. - Hello, you. - So... Congratulations, then. - Is that the little art baby in there? - Maybe so. - Yes ? A real art baby ? - Well done. Where are Sofie and Shanti ? Sofie couldn't make it, and we can't have an uneven number. I'll just pop over and have a look at the room. Oh, well. Nice to see you all again. Oh, what's this, then ? How far gone are they ? Five-six months ? - I don't know. Could they be ? - They are well into it. Of course, women vary in size, but... So, she'll have her art baby. I bet you it's what she always wanted. Shall I find out ? Whether they're yours ? Yes. - So, how's it going ? - Well, thanks. And how are you down in the studio ? It's about Mikael. It's not very good. Because of the pregnancies ? Yes. The situation's gotten very tense. - I'm concerned it'll get out of hand. - You mean... Like he'll drink and... Speak out ! Are you concerned he'll start drinking and doing drugs ? Of course I am ! Alcohol, drugs, all that shit ! The lot. That he sinks into the depths. I understand. Okay. So... What ? What do you mean, what ? He's afraid Anna'll tell the press he's the father. I understand. Bearing his family in mind and all... Both you and I know that baby is not his. Not his, no... How can we be sure ? - So, she hasn't said anything to you ? - No. There was talk about art babies earlier, but after she got pregnant, she hasn't spoken about it at all. ...a different level. It's a totally different level. She should be working with amateurs. She's dealing with the best Nordic actors around. She should go home, have the baby and not come back until she's got a proper script. A real director knows what she wants. Has a sense of direction. And status. I wouldn't have accepted if I knew I was playing an idiot ! - Holy shit ! - Sorry. I'm sorry. - Just don't tell anyone about this. - You're not pregnant ! No. She wanted us to do this. Believing in things would give an authentic feel. So, she wanted all of you to believe that we were pregnant with an art baby each. - Shit... - So, she's not pregnant either ? - This is sick ! - Yes. - This is not funny. - No. It isn't funny. Good morning ! - Morning. - Good morning. - How are you, Jens ? - Fine, thanks. Sometimes, I seriously doubt what we're doing. We've got food and drink. We're well looked after. Who cares ? What's your view, Mikael ? Say something, dammit ! I'm just amused that you're so upset. - Oh, you're not ? - No. I'm relieved. That I haven't made anyone pregnant. - What ? - Yes ? - Sorry, Vera. Clumsy of me. - What's this ? - Are you not pregnant ? - No. - What ? - I can't believe it ! You're seriously not going around faking being pregnant ? - Are you ? - Leave her alone. Don't you see how mental this is ? Anna's trying to scare you. - True, she is. - And she's fucked you all ! Is there anyone with a dick who hasn't fucked Anna ? - I paid her a visit once, but... - Jens ? Goddammit, Jens ! It is totally sick. Totally insane. - Today, we're doing an exercise... - Anna. The object of which is that our alter egos will talk about our innermost feelings. Through you, we will become the truest versions of ourselves. Or that we could potentially be. Jens - just imagine not having to feel afraid any more. Or that you don't need to be worried about being nobody. Are you serious ? - What is it you don't get ? - What I don't get ? Listen... Now, you're crossing every line. Totally and utterly. You're over the top. Totally off-piste. Do you realise I'm two seconds from leaving this project ? - Two seconds ! - Trine ? Calm down. Come with me. We need to talk. I know what I'm doing. As an artist, a human being and a director. But obviously not as an actor. - You needn't pretend to be pregnant. - I never pretend ! Shut up. I want all of you to understand that it's vital that we can show ourselves naked to each other. Everything we do in here carries meaning. - I have nothing to hide from you. - Okay. Tomorrow, you will all get full access to the entire script. It's going to be fucking brilliant. And tonight, we're going out to celebrate. Need help ? - Hiding something ? - It'll all be revealed in due course. Please excuse me. Had you been less damn full of yourself, this art film could have been off the ground ages ago. Oh, I see. This is an art film we're doing ? Call it what you want. Is your art baby part of this great piece of art ? Will we know who's the father when we watch this art film ? Will we ? When did you last fuck Mikael ? Ask yourself. Sure, but there are plenty of us here. Hell knows what side you've been fucking. You're insane ! What's she saying ? No one takes any responsibility for this production. No one's accountable. This fucking production lacks adults ! - No... What's she saying ? - She's insane. - Okay. - She's damaged. Deranged for real. What do I do now ? You shouldn't sit there and take it. Should you ? You should talk to the producer and show him who's boss. You'll go straight to him and tell him what you think about all this. I will ! You're a fucking arse of a producer ! Aren't you ? Come here. Here. - Should I... - Go ahead. Isn't it great breathing fresh air ? Eight, please. And two non-alcoholic ones as well. Here you go. And one for Anna. I think there's one missing over there. Enjoy it while you can. Tomorrow we'll get our much longed-for script. Let's drink to that ! - Cheers. - Cheers ! I can have two. Do we drink a toast in Danish or Swedish ? Anna's prepared something tomorrow for the script presentation. Sounds exciting. A great big bonfire in the parking lot. She asked me to get two cans of petrol. - She asked you for two cans of petrol? - Yes. - Do you realise she's back there now ? - To prepare for tomorrow. Have you read the script ? Anna ! You were born. And so you are free. So happy birthday. X&Y", "url": "https://subslikescript.com/movie/XY-8587142"},

Hey, can you give me an advance? I'll pay you back. I promise. - For the trip? - Yeah. When will you be back? When I've finished my business. Of course. How's that? Cool! Thanks a lot! Hey, those spells you told me about… What? \n \n \n \n    (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n \n Those absences, do you still have them? No. I'm good! - Are you sure? - Yeah. OK, I gotta run. Come now… Take care. Yeah. And call me, huh? Could you buy me some credit to call you? OK. Who's that? Who? Her? Patty Pravo. How do you know her? She's a goddess! - Really? - Yeah. OK, bye! Put on your jacket. (in Albanian) It's chilly. Dido, this is Athens! Well, Piraeus, really. Smile! Toast with ham, cheese, bacon, mustard, and omelet. Dany! Hey, Ody! Don't call me Ody. Why're you here? I told you. Toast with… - When did you arrive? - An hour ago. With mustard! Dimitra! - Can you make it? - OK. With mustard, Dimitra! - You look cute! - I said not to come to Athens. Well, I'm here now. If you've come to make trouble, beat it! (in Albanian) You hear me? Go back to your mother in Crete. I can't! Why not? Jenny's no more. What do you mean? She's dead. Odysseas, the toast's ready! 10 days ago. Are you shitting me? I called you several times, but you didn't answer. I couldn't blurt it out in a text. It's your birthday soon, so I preferred to come see you. But I spoke to her. I know. I came home 2 days later and found her on the sofa. Pulmonary edema, the doctor said. She had too much to drink. And took her pills. Maybe a bit too much. What'll I do with you? You belong behind the counter. Not talking to friends. If you're not happy, there are plenty of others waiting. Wait here. What about money for the funeral? Jenny had 2,000 euros in the bank. A fortune! She could've had millions. Yes. If she hadn't burned out. It wasn't her fault! She worked hard. Stop saying that! Hello. A pack of the usual. And this. Thanks. Let's go. It's not Bollywood here! - Don't look. Stay cool. - Why? You're in Greece and don't speak Greek? Fucking bastards! Be quiet. Those fascists don't scare me! When they're in a group, keep quiet. This is Athens. It's the same in Crete. We don't look like Albanians. You look like a fag. That's worse. We don't look Albanian, but we are. Half. You're Albanian, Dany! And a fag. The mountains… and the sea. Perfect! Hey… Don't shame me in front of my roommate. Look at me, OK? Yes, Dad! Ody! It's ready! SUGAR Come eat! Ody, we're eating! After Athens and Patras, the casting… Leave it. … Of \"Greek Star\" continues in Thessalonica. Sign up on the site… Don't call me Ody! … and make your dreams come true! Who'll be the new Greek star? My brother, motherfuckers! - Who? - Ody. He'd win easily. It's \"Greek Star\", not \"Albanian Star\"! The nationality doesn't matter. You've got hidden talents? Great! (in Albanian) If you're a star, you'll get your Greek girl at last. Go on, tell him, Ody! Shut up, you asshole! Stop ranting. Your mother's dead, dammit. Fuck you! It was Jenny's dream for you to take part in a talent show! You get fucked — it'll do you good! Eat, it's going cold. Our mother was a singer. A great voice. She could sing anything. Italian, Greek… Ody inherited her talent. It's sweet. Good, huh? Come with me. - Where to? - Come on! - Where? - Hurry up! Hang on. - Come on! - My bag. Hurry up! Bye. This way. It's great here! If you want to stay in Athens, you'll have to calm down. I've not done a thing! Your mother's dead, you heartless bastard. I'm heartless? What about you? You abandoned her! That's not true. She sent me to her uncle when I was 14! Just for the summer. And you never came back. What for? To put her to bed drunk every night? And put up with her asshole boyfriends? To not leave me alone! I was the one who took care of it all! So, don't come it with me! Fuck you! Here. No, thanks. Come on, Dido. Is that the Acropolis? Yes. Still got that rabbit? Yes, why? You're 16, goddammit! In 2 months. And you're nearly 18! - Fuck it! - Why? Jenny screwed up, she lost her residence permit. So, we did, too. She didn't tell you? No. In a few days' time, I could be deported. Thanks, Jenny! What'll you do? I dunno. An NGO lawyer who deals with immigrants said she'd help me. You're in a mess. You're not eating? Oh, I didn't tell you! What? Before she died, Mom said that \"The Unspeakable\" was alive. What? Tassos told her that \"The Unspeakable\" lived in Thessalonica. Tassos? How did she find Tassos? He called Jenny. To make friends again. Tassos ran into \"The Unspeakable\" in a club. He remarried and changed his name. He's loaded, too! She was glad to have found Tassos, but she started drinking and insulting \"The Unspeakable\". As usual. She wanted him to do a DNA test since I'm a minor. To get some money. Bullshit. Why? We could get the money and Greek nationality! No-one could deport you! - If he'd wanted to find us… - Screw him! We have no father. Forget it! What're you doing? Making the bed. - We're sleeping here? - Yes. It's too hot downstairs. Give me a hand. What'll you have? A Coke. Drink your Coke and get out. Minors can't come in here. - So, you're Jenny's son? - Yes. - You're looking for Tassos? - Yes. Why don't you ask your mother? She died 2 weeks ago. Sorry. That's why I'm looking for him. They'd fallen out. Yes, I know. I fell out with him, too, 5 or 6 years ago. He'd become unmanageable. He drank and fought with everyone. She told me he'd opened a club. I can't remember where. So I heard. In Larissa. The Paradiso. Darling! The Paradiso? Yes, that's it. - Hey, Mr Costa. - Hey, Moustafa. - A beer. - Denis, a beer. What's your name? Dany. Hi. Moustafa. Dance. Come! No. Dance! That. With that. And that. You long in Greece? I was born here. You not Albanian? I am Albanian! - Here? - Yes. How much do you charge? 20 euros. But too hard find clients. Me want 1,000 euros to go Italy. You come with me? I can't. Why not? I'm going to Thessalonica. Thessalonica? Why? To find my father. Fascists! Get outta here! The fascists. Death to Arabs! Greece for the Greeks! What're you looking at? Leave her! Leave her, you cunts! Leave him alone! Run! Run! Where are you? Hey, you. Come here! I brought the Albanian kid. Leave us alone for a minute. Hi. I'm Antigone, Odysseas's lawyer. We spoke on the phone. Did they do that to you here? What's that? What? His shoulder's all bruised! No idea. I never saw the kid before. Please come. The car's waiting. Take off his cuffs. We obey orders, ma'am. Come with me. Now what? The cuffs aren't necessary! Take them off at once. Please! He's a minor and it's the law. I was born here. And I'm a minor! Yes, that's why we can win. But we're half Greek, too. Your brother's waiting outside. - Where's my bag? - You'll get it when you leave. - Don't talk to him. - One minute! One minute. You screwed up again. Are you OK? Everything's alright. He'll go to a center. We'll try to get him out as soon as possible. - Don't let me go there! - It's only temporary. Definitely! And security's not tight. Let's go to Thessalonica. It's now or never! You'll win \"Greek Star\". And we'll get the money and Greek nationality. Like Jenny said. Forget it. Let's go! Ody, please! Hi. Toast with ham, cheese, and mustard. Coming right up. What're you doing here? I left. You ran away? It really sucked there. Let me sleep. I'm beat. Wake up! We're leaving! What? I've been looking for you for an hour. What is it? We missed the bus! Come on. It's OK. Relax. Come on. There you are, my boy! I can't walk any further in this heat. Serves you right. Come on. Let's hitch a ride. With your look? What's wrong with it? Forget it. Let's rehearse your song. No. I thought of a more recent song. No. It'll be \"Tutt'al più\" like Mom taught you. I assure you! Don't forget, Patty Pravo brings luck! I don't have a thing to wear. You're fine like that. Miss Tassos will have some vintage clothes for you. I'll do your hair. Oh, great! You talk. - Good evening. - Hello. We want to talk to Tassos Peris. Mr Tassos? What about? - We're family. - Family. Wait here. What's up, boys? I don't believe it! Maria Sonia, our Ukrainian star! She'll have the whole of Greece at her feet! And now, a song… for a goddess who left too soon. For Jenny! Perhaps… You'll go one day perhaps… Hey, Tassos sent me over. Sit down. Odysseas. That's Dany. Perhaps… Everything will change perhaps And we will mourn perhaps Our lost dreams… Sit down. Get the milk out of the fridge. Yes, Tassos. Bottom left. Thanks. Why are you going to Thessalonica? To make Ody the new star, or to find \"The Unspeakable\"? I called him that. Both reasons. Why? In the fridge. Because, my dear, you could be the next star if you've kept your voice. I get by OK. But as for getting hold of the money… I'll handle him. No-one messes with me! I'd noticed. Got anything sweet? Again? You'll start attracting flies! Here. - Thanks. - Just one. Say you find him. What if I were wrong? Aren't you sure? You told Jenny it was him! Yes, the guy I saw in a club in Thessalonica. He's a far right candidate over there. Far right? That's right. It's his day job. At night, he offers protection to clubs. Drugs, girls, the usual stuff. Scumbag! In the fridge. You're not sure it's him? Listen. If it's him, he's changed his name. He's called Christopoulos. His first name's still Lefteris. He's changed a lot in 15 years. 12 and a bit… 12 years, hey? - What does he look like? - Physically? Me or Odysseas? You don't remember him? No. When he left, you didn't eat for a month. I don't remember. I do, a bit. You? You were scarcely 2! I'd fall asleep on his chest. He was really hairy. We can't remember things from when we're 2. Let's go into the living room. Here. Tassos? Yes. This photo was at your place, in Crete. Song Festival, 1981. 1st prize, it says. Past glories. Instead of crying about it, smoke a joint. As Jenny's sons, you can't mind. I do. Cut the crap. So, what was he like? Who? \"The Unspeakable\". He was so hot when he was young. Tall, dark… A real hunk. Darker than you! A lot more than you, kid! When I look at the two of you, you don't look like him. You look like your mother. 'Evening! It's Achmad. We've lived together for 3 years. Without him, I'd be with your mother now. Did everything go OK at the club? Yes. Except Costas who was bitching, as usual. He's on the way out. I made some toast. Thanks. Listen… What a coincidence! You'll never guess what I was listening to, 2 days ago. Ready? Patty! A goddess. Your mother adored her. Do you remember our dance? Let's see. Come on, Dany. 5, 6, 7, 8! And change. Lefteris Christopoulos candidate \"I'm not a fascist, I'm a patriot.\" That's great, Odysseas! You didn't even rehearse it! Maria, you've made progress. It's him! He's shit-hot! You have a very pretty voice. You sing well together. That's rare. For the audition, you should choose a Greek song. Something light-hearted and upbeat. You know what I mean. We thought about that, but… Let's take it from the top. Put your cigarette out. Now! Sorry. Hey, Dany. - What's up? - We're rehearsing. Why are you rehearsing? For the audition. We thought of a Greek song. What? We already know what you're going to sing. The jury doesn't like shitty Greek songs. It's not a shitty song. Don't forget you were raised on them for years! With Jenny, we listened to Patty Pravo. You'll sing Patty Pravo! No-one asked you! - Calm down, kid. - No way. - Shut up. - I won't shut up! This third-rate old queen can't suddenly tell us what to do! When we needed him, he ran away. Now he's lecturing us. Fuck him! Shut your mouth! Fuck you! Dany, stop. Stop it! Leave him alone. I don't mind. I can't breathe! What's going on? Calm down. You'll sing \"Tutt'al più\", OK? Go fuck the lot of you! It's the fag from earlier on. (in Albanian) Look at this faggot. Do you want to suck my lollipop? I don't suck limp dicks. Ask your buddy. He's Albanian like us! What did you say? Asshole! Say that again, ass bandit! Look at your faces in the mirror! Shitheads! - Forget it, Baskim! - No way. Say that again! I'll bust your ass — you'll like that. Aren't you sick of them screwing you? He puts us Albanians to shame. The real shame is your needle pricks. Say that again! Fuck you. Stop it! Come here, you fag. He's got a gun! Leave him alone! Stop it! Drop that gun! Shit, he's hit! Come on. Run! This way. Stop! Stay where you are! I can't carry on. Sit down. My bag. Let me see your leg. Gently. Is it sprained? I dunno. Have a rest. C'mon, let's go. I can't… Get on my back. It's OK. - Wait here. - Where are you going? Are you hurt, Dido? Here. Don't drink it all. That's enough. Drink. Where's the gun? I dunno. I dropped it. - Are you sure? - Yes. If they find it, we're done for. Take him. What? Take him. Why? He's suffering. Kill him so he stops suffering. What? Take him! Dany, you're freaking me out! Kill him! I can't bear to see him! Will you cut the crap? I can't bear to see him. Kill him! That's enough! Take him! Please! Alright, alright! - Kill him! - Kill what? Kill him! Are you joking? It's Dido. Do it! Do what? It's Dido. Kill him. He's in pain. Do what, dammit? Look! Sorry. Calm down. Is there anyone here? It's empty. I always dreamed of living in a four-star hotel. Shit, my battery's dead. Does yours work? 100 calls from Miss Tassos. Give it to me. Hello? At last! Are you OK? Yes. Thank God. Just a moment. Bye, boys. Thanks very much. Where are you? I dunno. Far away. In a hotel. We ran into a spot of trouble… I know. The police just left. You were seen in the club. Who fired? The kid? Yes. I knew it. Where did he find the gun? In Crete? I dunno. I guess so. He's lucky. He hit the guy in the leg. He'll survive. Thank God! The police are after you. I said nothing. The captain's a good customer. I said you were rentboys from Trikala. I hope you're not near there. I don't think so. Lay low for a few days. They'll stop looking for you. How's the kid? He hurt his ankle. Serves him right! Put him on. Here. Hello. You were right. I'm sorry… What about? You know what I mean! Does it hurt? No. It'll be OK. Listen, tell your brother if things screw up with \"The Unspeakable\", I'll take over. With Achmad. Wouldn't he be a great dad? Right. Be careful. - Yes, Tassos. - Bye, Dany. Where did you find the gun? - In Crete. - Did you steal it? Not exactly. What did you want to do with it? I dunno. It can come in handy. Are you shitting me? Do you realize what you're saying? You almost killed someone. Do you understand? They attacked me first. Have you gone insane? It's not a toy. You don't go shooting at people. You can hit and punch, but you can't shoot! Do you wanna fuck everything up? I want to go to Thessalonica and you to become a star. Oh, yeah? By fucking everything up? I'm sick of it! So, leave! I can't leave you. - So I'll go. - You're going nowhere! - Get off. - You're going nowhere, understand? - My foot! - What? It hurts. Get off me. Give me your money. Let go of my foot first. Is that all? Stay here till I get back. - Fuck you! - Got that? Happy birthday, big brother! Thank you. Welcome to our hotel. What'll you have? Souvlaki. My vase! This is for you. Thanks. Shampoo. Soap to get washed. A lamp. And loudspeakers for my birthday. Did you have enough money? Yes. No way. Where did you get the money? None of your business. What did you do all this time? Shopping. It's my birthday. I do what I want! Come on, rinse me off! - You're fine. - Any soap on me? No, nothing. Stop it! What a shit-hot view! Yeah, great! Stop drinking. It's my birthday. I do what I want. So… when we get the money from \"The Unspeakable\", I'll send 5,000 to Grandma Alma and with the rest, I'll go to America. Hold your horses, Di Caprio! Forget America. Why? We'll have Greek nationality and a passport. Yes, but you might get caught and end up in jail. And you're a minor. I won't let you go. We'll share the money when you're 18. Then, do what you like. What'll you do with the money? First I'll go to Crete. I won't go back there. Then, I'll buy this hotel and fix it up. You'll never have enough money. Then I'll rent it. I'll make it a fuckin' great hotel and I'll live in it. What a genius! To Xenia. It's \"Xen-í-a\", ignoramus. Shit! \"Rumore\"?! Where did you find it? - Carry on dancing! - You can't! Do you miss Jenny? Yes. You should do the audition. No way. I can't sing. You have more talent. You're more sexy, more… … gay. C'mon, let's go in. Jeez! Jeez, \"Rumore\"! Is it really you? Yes. But you're not real? Does it matter? No. You've grown big! Enormous! You've grown big, too. Since yesterday? Ody turned 18 today. I know. You look bigger, too. We killed you. What's it like? What? Being killed. It hurts. I'm sorry. I miss you. I have to go. It'll be daylight soon. Will you come back? 'Morning. Here… C'mon, get up! This early? Yes. - I had a bit too much to drink. - Yes. - Here. - OK! Hurry up, we're going to be late. Let's go! Give it more emotion! Think about your dream that's coming true… Right here and now. On \"Greek Star\"! Thanks. Take 10, then we'll film the trailer. Isn't that Maria? Don't go too far away! Hey. - Hey. - Come here. What're you doing here? Tassos sent me. He gave me this. Thanks. And I thought I might as well try my luck. Quite right. Come on, I'll show you. You go. I'll have a look around. - Stay nearby. - OK. Hello. I'm calling from the \"Fame\" press office. We have an invitation for Mrs Christopoulos for Jean Paul Gaultier's show tomorrow, here in Thessalonica. Can we give it to her in person? Yes, I'll hold. Just a second. Go ahead. Panorama… OK. Thanks a lot. Goodbye. Wow! The \"Fame\" offices are nice n' spacious! Fuck! Use this. - Thanks. - You're welcome. - Should I wet my hair? - No… Give it here. Don't be scared. Bend down! Here for the audition? Not me. My brother. Get down lower. I'm singing \"Satisfaction\". Great. Stop it! Cut it out! You're ready. Neat! Thanks! You're welcome. - Are you from Thessalonica? - Crete. Really? - How did you get here? - Long story. You? I came from Serres yesterday. No brother. Stefanos. Dany. Hi. What was that shit on the phone? None of your business! Whatever. I must've missed my turn. - Let's go! - Where? Come on! Wait. They'll let me go on in a minute. Wait for me? I dunno. I've got things to do. Jean Paul Gaultier? Tonight I'll be going to the Alexandra. You'd like it. It's on the beach. Will you come? Promise? OK. Good luck! - You say \"Break a leg\". - Break a leg! What number? 35. Are you nervous? Not very. Tassos told me to wear this so I won't look cheap. Think I look cheap? No. Well? Do you like it? So-so. You're right, forget it. You're very pretty. Yeah, sure… Look at me. You are. Are you going like that? Yeah. Don't you like it? I do. You look a nice boy. I am a nice boy. I'm sure you'll win. You too. I don't really care. I'd like to go away. Go away? Where? Back to Ukraine? No. I can't go back anymore. To Europe. I hear Germany's good. It's hard to go there with my papers. For me, too. Do you want to go to Albania? Yes. Out of curiosity. But I'd be even more of a stranger there. Well, we're strangers everywhere. We're at home everywhere, too. Who is it? A delivery. For Mrs Christopoulos. \"Fame\" press office. Thank you. What do you want? I'm calling the police! Don't be scared, I wanted to meet you. I want to see your husband. What for? To get acquainted. Your husband, Lefteris Christopoulos, is my father. My biological father. I'm here on business, so I wanted to see him. Mom, can we go play downstairs? Hi! I'm Dany. What's her name? Go watch a DVD. Now! - Why? - Because. Run along! It's shit-hot here! Where are you going? Wait. Wait! I said, wait! Come here. Listen, you're making a mistake. No, I'm not. Your husband is my father and I came to meet him, OK? Either he didn't tell you he had other kids or you're playing dumb. What's your name? He's not the one you think! What's your name? Vivi… Vassiliki. Vivi or Vassiliki? I tell you, my husband isn't the one you're looking for! We got married 6 years ago. He wasn't married before that! If he had been, I wouldn't be here! At the time, he had a different name. He met my mother, Jenny when she came from Albania in '92. Who? Jenny, my mother! She's Albanian? No, Congolese! She attended Tirana music academy to be a singer. He offered to help her and sent her to a sleazy nightclub. The idiot fell in love with him. He gave her 2 kids and made her turn tricks. One fine day, he disappeared into thin air! We never saw him again. Really? You're wrong. It's not him! Go away! - I'm going nowhere! - Leave! Call him and ask him! Call him! Yes, Lefteris… No… not really. There's a young man here. An Albanian. He says he's your son. I don't know! In the house. Yes, he's here. Please. Now. He's coming. Great. - That's the pool? - It's not working. Pity. Mom, can we play downstairs? No, you go watch your cartoon. We'll be eating soon. OK. Mrs Vivi, do you have anything for me? I haven't eaten since this morning. Got any eggs? Now? OK, we're coming. - Are you number 1053? - Yes. - You're on next. - We're due tomorrow. We've speeded things up. Are you coming? - Yes. - Come on. It'll be fine. How old are you? 16… 15 and 9 and a half months. And you live here? Not here. I lived in Crete. Now I don't know. You're a real Albanian? No, 'cause my father's Greek. Thanks to him, I can get a Greek passport. Vivi! Your father's here. Come on. Go on! What happened? He came in and made a scene. You let him in? Yes. He said he had a delivery. - Where is he? - In the kitchen. - What's he doing? - Eating. - Eating what? - Eggs. - You made him eggs? - Yes. - Tell him to come. - You tell him. Hey! Take the kids upstairs. They can stay here. The kids are going upstairs. Christos, Caterina, run upstairs! I'll be right with you. Do you know him? Calm down. I've never seen him before. I was 2 years old when you left. You've changed, too! - He says he's your son. - You know I only have 1 son! And 2 others in Crete! In Crete? What're you talking about? Go or I'll call the cops. Great! Call them. No kidding? Pick up the phone! Really? - What're you waiting for? - Out! - No, man. Call the cops. - Beat it! Get lost! Scram, you scumbag! Or there'll be trouble! Get up! Aren't you a wild one? Downstairs. I'm coming. In just a minute. I said, move! I'll see to the kids. Be quick, Mrs Vivi. You're the scumbag. I can see you! Come on… Drop the gun. Let's go outside. Talk man to man, not in front of the kids. The kids? No kidding! Sit down! Just what do you want? Sit on the chair. OK. I'm sitting down. Legal recognition and money, what you owe us. What I owe you? How much? 100,000? Oh, really? Listen, kid. What's your name? Natacha! You don't remember? Make an effort. Dany, short for Daniel. I put them in their room. OK, Dany. Let's start over. - Calm down. - I am calm. You come in, threaten my wife in front of my kids, wave a gun around, and say you want money. I'll give you money, but I'm not who you think I am. I'm not your father… There's been a mistake, see? Your mistake was making me! Sit down! Where's your mother? I'll call her and explain I'm not the one you're looking for. It's too late. She died 2 weeks ago. Who would know your father? Someone must. Him! Hello? Where are you, dammit? I'm on in 2 minutes! What? Already? They said… I'm on now. Maria wasn't chosen. They're idiots! I'm sick of it. Where are you? Come on. I can't. I'm far away. Far away? What the fuck! Number 1061? It's my turn. Screw it. I'm not going. Ody, calm down. Relax. Sing like Jenny taught you and it'll be fine. Think of her! Hurry up. Are you 1061? Let's go. It's me next. Bravo! Don't hang up, I want to hear you. It's not allowed. Make something up. Say your grandfather's sick. Please! Don't hang up. I want to hear it. Ody, do you hear me? OK, hang on. Hello. My name's Odysseas. - You're from Albania? - Yes. You have a very Greek name. Yes. I was born in Crete, I'm… You're what? Nothing. I'm a bit nervous. It's only natural. What're you going to sing? An Italian song from the 60s, \"Tutt'al più\". By Patty Pravo. How do you know her? Long story. You need your phone? It's for my brother. Phones aren't allowed. He's in Crete, he's sick. Very sick. It's thanks to him that I'm here. He coached me. OK, your brother can listen in. Go on. Shut up and listen! Bravo, it was great. You were amazing! Can you hear me? Clap! What? Odysseas, did your brother like it? Ask him. Is he still on the line? Hello? Can you hear me? Clap! OK, that's enough. Can you hear? Yeah. Did you like it? You nailed it, man! You sang better than Jenny. What does the jury say? Enough! What's going on? Hands up! I said, hands up! Mrs Vivi… Where are you? Who's Vivi? Everything's fine. - What was that? - Nothing. Everything's OK. Where are you? You went after him! Fuck, fuck, fuck! What did the jury say? We said we'd go together! Don't do anything stupid. I'm on my way! Where are you? Panorama. 35 Metaxa Street. Take a taxi, it's 10 euros. Who's coming? Your other son. Who? Mrs Vivi! Stop being so formal! It's getting on my nerves. Jenny taught us to be polite to older women. She hated familiarities. Especially with strangers. Got something sweet? What? Some candy. Toffee, chocolate, a lollipop… Super, my favorite! Can you unwrap it? Thank you. Take your jacket off. - What? - Your jacket. Take it off! Good. Your shirt, too. What? Take your shirt off! Why? Because I said so! Take it off. You shave? Mrs Vivi, does he shave? Ask who it is first! - Who is it? - Odysseas. Open up! Quick! Here. In the living room! The bastard shaves! I don't! You lied to me. You were going to get rid of it. Give me the gun. No, he'll kill us! Give! He says it's not him. It is him, isn't it? He's not the one who cradled you. What? Tassos did. \"The Unspeakable\" didn't give a damn! You seem like a reasonable guy. Your brother fired the gun. We nearly had carnage! It's not my fault. He tried to kill me! Let's get this over with! Your brother's sick. He's not well! What? He talks crazy nonsense. What nonsense? That I'm your father. Aren't you? It's him, Ody! It's him! No, it's not true. What if it was you? What if it was me, what? This is insane! What if it was you? Look at me! Do you remember me? Do you remember me? Tell him, Ody! Do you remember me? What? Do you remember me? You're crazy, too! Fuck… I'll give you the cash I have here. It's in the drawer. He gave her a look! Lefteris, not again! Enough! Get off my brother! Leave him alone! Get off him. Get off him! Fuck you! Are you OK? It's just a scratch. I'll bring some alcohol from the kitchen. Go on, speak! Say what? That morning, I asked you why you were packing your case. You said: \"Quiet. Don't wake the others.\" You took the money from the kitchen drawer. You said you'd be back later, with gifts. Is that the truth or not? I made you promise. And you promised me. Is that true or not? Is it? Because I waited for you. Speak, you fucker! Speak! Get it over with! Speak! Say yes. Yes! Why didn't you come back? That's enough. It's over. It's over, do you understand? Right… I'll give you all our cash. Then, you go, OK? And tomorrow, you'll get the rest. Recognition papers, DNA test… I don't want your recognition. Nor do I. I don't want to see you again, fascist pig! Enough! Just go. My bag. Now go! Thanks, Dad! It's a hell of a place! Goodbye, Mrs Vivi. Kiss the kids from us. Before you came, I wasn't sure it was him. What're you doing? Stop it. Enough. It was him, right? Maybe. - Was it or wasn't it? - Who cares? He was a jerk anyway! There's not a single taxi around here. And no kiosk, either. I wouldn't live here if you paid me. - Maria's waiting for me. - Call her, dummy! Everything's OK… Where are you? We'll be there in 20 minutes. Bye. I'm not going with you. Why not? Something to do. So, did they pick you or not? I don't think so, seeing as I ran off. But I did good, didn't I? Are you kidding? You fucking nailed it! Next month, there are auditions for \"Greece Has Got Talent\". We'll take part. Isn't that a kiosk? Where? Come on! The last one is a rotten egg! - 1st! - 2nd! Thanks. Riccardo. As well as the cigarettes, please get some mint chewing gum. Thanks. Ciao, amore! - See that? - What? Shit! - Run! - Where? Fuck! What came over you? Didn't you see her? Who? In the car! Who was it? It was Patty Pravo! No kidding? I swear! Yeah, sure! She even spoke to me. - Patty Pravo? - Yes! What did she say? She said: \"Ciao.\" \"Ciao\" … something. Goddess! Oh, Dany, you'll never grow up! Always imagining things! A film by Panos H.

She was Xena, a mighty princess forged in the heat of battle. The power. The passion. The danger. Her courage will change the world. XENA: WARRIOR PRINCESS \n \n \n \n    (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n \n Looking out at the cosmos makes you think... about where we are..., where we've been..., where we're going now. Yeah. And like the bigger now. I mean, Gabrielle, what are we gonna do? Wander around Greece our whole lives looking for trouble? Why don't we go away? Far away? Whaddya say? I can't believe you're awake, much less listening to me. Let's go south, to the land of the pharaohs. I hear they're in need of a girl with a chakram. You know that there's somebody out there. \n \n \n \n    (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n \n Yeah, he's been trying to find us the past half-hour. Are you all right? Oh. Yes. Thank you. Whoa! Are you Xena? Who's askin'? A messenger, sent by Akemi. Akemi? You saw Akemi? Several weeks ago..., I was journeying with another monk through a forest, near the town of Higuchi. It started to rain..., and we sought shelter at a teahouse. Kenji..., not even you could be frightened of this. Your shuji has great dignity and beauty. I am blessed with a certainty... about what it means to be a monk. But my companion... was not as steadfast in his resolve. You must leave... now. Come on! What?! I know you're a good man. In the teahose, I felt the compassion in your heart. Don't fear me. Who-Who... Who was that demon?! The Lord of the Dark Land. He's preparing an army to wage war in Higuchi... and slowly, the populace. Honorable monk..., I beg you to do what must be done: to stop him enslaving the souls of that city. But I'm no swordsman! There's one in the west... far beyond the setting sun. A samurai?! A priest?! A god?! No. A warrior princess. Xena, you must save Higuchi from destruction. The Land of the Rising Sun. That's beyond Chin[a]. I didn't know you were there, Xena. Yes, I was there. I was there. Gabrielle, this is not going to be the trip that I promised you..., but if Akemi calls, I must go. Wherever you go, I'm by your side. I knew you'd say that. The way of the sword... is the most ancient of the warrior's art. With practice, the samurai develops the sacred virtues of bravery..., self-discipline, and honor. A samurai would rather die a warrior than live as a coward. This Akemi who sent for Xena..., what do you know about her? She was forced by Yodoshi..., the Lord of the Dark Land..., to seduce souls... into his grasp. She's very beautiful. - And she's a ghost. - She's a...? Gabrielle, before we reach Japa..., I should tell you everything that happened there last time. Many years ago..., Borias told me about a young girl who was kidnapped by a Chinese warlord. She'd been taken hostage from a mighty island... even further east than Chin[a]. Being the kind of person I was then..., the challenge of finding a new land to plunder was just too much for me. I had to meet her. So, her daddy's rich, you say? And powerful. He should pay well for the return of his sweet daughter. Come. - Akemi, meet... - ...Xena, the Warrior Princess. You know me? Oh, yes. I've heard that you're afraid of nothing. Kao, here..., - he's afraid of many things. - This girl has spirit. This girl deserves to die..., speaking like that in front of my guests. You won't kill me. Xena won't let you. Because in her heart... she knows that she will soon love me. Xena loves no one. I'll be your student, Xena. You'll take me with you. You'll teach me everything you know. I have a few lessons for you! Here. Fifty pieces of gold. It's the best offer you'll get for her. I do what I want with my property. I say this isn't a good day to trade. Is it a good day to die? It's unhealthy to negotiate with this one. I'd take the gold. Guards! I've shut off the flow of blood to your brain. You got ten, nine, eight... Ah, forget it. I would have taken the gold. You know, Borias, I have a dream..., a dream of conquering every land between here and Brittania. Xena, you're always looking for green pastures to rape and pillage. Yep. And maybe there's more in this than just the ransom, huh? I mean, with her father as an ally, I could get a nice toehold on that island. What makes you so sure she'll lead you to daddy? Ah, she wouldn't lie to me. Hmm. She worships her teacher. What's so funny? Xena, you couldn't teach a dog to bark. Akemi! Come here, I wanna show you something. You're wrong. Xena will be a great teacher. I'm ready. All right. If someone's comin' atcha with a right/left combination..., this is what I wantcha to do. You feint back, twist in the direction of the blow, and then deliver a vicious jumping, spinning back-kick. All right? Right. So..., that's right, a left, a feint, uh, a jumping, swinging... Jumping, spinning back-kick. All right. Now, I'll be a bad guy. Hmm. Lesson One: trust no one. Remember, Xena, I get 10% of the ransom. Good luck, teacher. Come on, Akemi, keep up. My ribs are still a little sore. Well, next time we'll start with something a little simpler. Like listening. Listen to that. To what? To life and death. Every sound, every movement is a message. A wagon just crossed a creek up ahead. A deer grazing nearby. When you listen to the Kami like that..., you must be at peace. The Kami? What's that? The Kami are the powers behind all nature. They make the sun shine, the grass grow. They brought you to me. No, no, no. When I listen like that, I'm at war. Every sound is a possible warning of an enemy approaching. I believe that one day, Xena..., the Kami will help you know peace. And I would be honored... if you would accept this. Oh. Uh... It's really pretty. It's our scripts. When my people are overcome with a feeling that needs to be preserved..., we write verse. Oh, yeah? - Like what feeling? - Love. Love? \"Yesterday..., the moon took lodging on my sleeve. Today..., I've hope for even the brokenhearted stars.\" So beautiful. To write something like that, she must have loved you very much. What's wrong? The truth is, Gabrielle..., she broke my heart. She broke your heart? I don't understand. For a while, I didn't understand myself. When I travelled with Akemi to her island for the ransom..., I was to learn that my heart was seeking something else. I thought I was taking you to your father. His castle's in the north. We came here first to visit my grandfather. He... died here... many years ago. Are you telling me that we've walked days in the wrong direction to see a dead guy?! We must visit my grandfather to seek his blessing. He's dead..., but... I can still speak to him. All your talk about moons up your sleeve..., you were playing me for a fool. I oughtta just...! You hear the Kami through the sounds of nature. In the same way, I hear sounds that are silent to you. My grandfather says that you are a wise and appropriate teacher. And... he feels your sword... is not good enough. There's a string of widows from here to Greece that say different. Compared to a katana... all other swords are toys. Well..., then get me one of those. The Great Katana lies near here. But... you must know. In our country... women are forbidden to own katana. Well, they're just gonna have to get used to it, aren't they? Sensei! I come bearing a challenge. My master wishes to fight you for possession of the Katana..., forged from the purest ore of the Hakiman temple. Your master must be a mighty samurai. Oh, no. I'm just a girl... in search of a really good sword. A woman? A foreigner?! Challenging us? For the sacred katana?! This is a great insolence! Well, I guess you're gonna have to teach me a lesson, hmm? Ooh, gimme, gimme! Yeah. Grandpa was right. Now, this is a sword. \"In a flurry of snow, two breaths of wind unite... and become as one..., and then disappear into each other.\" Listen, Akemi..., I don't want you to take this the wrong way. I really love this sword..., and you're a nice kid, but I just came for the ransom. I don't believe that. What do you hear now? Snow falling on cedars. No. Your heart... beating harder than normal. You're a master of war..., yet... you know no words to speak of love. And then you go and save my life. There's no greater gift of love a teacher can give a student than that. I have another gift I must ask of you. I saw what you did to kill that coward, Kao. It's a sacred trust. I would be honored, beyond words..., if you'd teach me that. All right. You knew her for a few weeks and you taught her the pinch? - Xena, in all the time... - Higuchi is under siege, and there's no place to dock. I'm turning back. What?! Gabrielle, I've got to go ashore. I'm with you. I knew you'd say that. The katana! You sent it to the foreign whore! Thank you. She's traveling to the city of Higuchi..., which my army right now... is destroying. My general awaits her..., and when he captures Xena and my katana..., she'll lose her head... to the sting of its blade. So, thank you..., daughter. Firebombs! They're going to burn Higuchi to the ground. We've gotta release the water from the tower. Gabrielle, what would you do? I saw these acrobats. - They used to... - Show me, Gabrielle. Climb on! All right. What's next? This way! Gabrielle! Whoa! Xena! Go for the ladder! Kill her! Retreat! A wise general knows when a fight is lost..., but I think we will meet again... soon. Whoohoo! We've won! We've won! Move! Move! We've won! We've won! Move! Move! This way! Follow me! Higuchi is saved. Not quite the way I would have done it, Gabrielle, but it sure worked. You know, Xena, I still don't understand. You taught Akemi the pinch. Did she ever use it? Yes, unfortunately she did. After a many days' walk, we reached her father's fortress. Akemi? Akemi, what are you doing? You've thirty seconds to live. My brothers..., my sisters..., my mother..., and my gentle grandparents. I avenge all your deaths... at the hands of this monster. - Father. - Father? I pray you suffer in death... the way your family suffered in life. What the hell did you do that for? It was my duty. He had to die. I don't care about that! What about the ransom?! Where's my money?! Forgive me, Xena. I don't suppose there's any inheritance in this! I have one last thing to ask of you. Restore my honor. The sacred katana. You want me to cut off...? That's why you wanted me to take the katana. After that is done..., take my ashes... and place them in the family shrine..., in the town of Higuchi. No, no. No, I'm not going to...! Akemi. I pray you will. \"The... snow melts. Flowers fade. And I pass... as all things do.\" You... \"But-But time... and love..., they go on.\" Restore my honor, Xena. Xena! How will you feel when you come face-to-face with Akemi's ghost? Better question is..., how will Xena feel... face-to-face... with the ghosts of the people she killed at Higuchi?! What?! Who are you? My family name is... Harukata. But he's known as the killer of ghosts. - Xena saved your city. - This time. But that does nothing to atone... for what happened... when last she was here! What's he talking about? I was fulfilling Akemi's dying wish: to place her ashes at the family shrine here in Higuchi. Word got out that I was honoring the ashes of a girl who'd killed her father. The townsfolk felt that I would be defiling their graveyard. They banded together to stop me. Xena. Bitch! Bitch! Go home, bitch! Go home, bitch! Go away! She killed her father! Go! Go! Go! Get out! Get out! - Get out! - Get out! Kill her! I tried to ignore them, but they came after me. Xena! Akemi! Akemi! Akemi! Watch out! Run! Run; fire! Fire! The wind took the fire... from house to house. 40.000 of my townsfolk... perished... in the flames! No, it's not possible. That is... only the beginning! Akemi told me that after she killed her father, Yodoshi's spirit was so full of evil, even the underworld would not allow him to enter. He became Lord Yodoshi..., the eater of souls. Now he holds them... inside him..., enslaved. If that is true..., then I am guilty of a greater evil than I ever thought possible. Xena, it was a horrible accident. No. No, I must put things right. Can you hear them? I thought I heard a horse before. Listen not just to the sounds..., but to what's behind the sounds. How many are there? At least three armies are gathering. The general we met at the water tower was right. We will meet again and soon. I'll warn the others. Ghost killer..., I know that you think of me as your enemy..., but you must believe this: my spirit aches for the torment I've caused. We both want... the same thing: to release those souls. You've devoted your life to killing Yodoshi. Why is it that you have never succeeded? I have the power... to slay him. But it is impossible for me to get close enough... to use my blade. Why? Because... I am mortal. Only... another ghost... can trap... a spirit as mighty as Yodoshi. Akemi..., I know what I must do. But I'm afraid that this day... what's done may not be undone. Xena, the militia is prepared. Why aren't you ready? Gabrielle, come here. Come here, give me your hands. All right. Here. Feel the surge of blood under the skin. - Now, just behind... - Xena. You don't have to do this. I understand why you would never wanna teach me the pinch. No. No, today more than ever... I want you to know what I know. Please. Why are you doing this? Gabrielle..., if I only had thirty seconds to live... this is how I'd want to live them..., looking into your eyes. Stop this. Stop it. Always remember: I love you. Why would you teach me this right now? I don't understand! There's nothing to understand. I just wanted you to know everything I know. Are you ready? Let's go, we got a battle to win. Wouldn't it be better if we stayed with Xena? Xena wants us to lead a contingent to the east plain. She said a group of Yodoshi's archers are gathering there. It's too quiet out here. Gabrielle, what would you do? (what would you do?) Listen not just to the sounds..., but to what's behind the sounds. (what's behind the sounds.) Always remember: I love you. (I love you. [...]) Xena! (Xena!) Xena! All right. Now you asked for it. Gabrielle! If I only had thirty seconds to live... We're going to be together. You brought out the best in me. Gabrielle! ...this is how I'd want to live them..., looking into your eyes. Xena! You came to me in my dreams... and I thought it was reality. Now you come to me in reality... and it feels like it's a dream. Either way, I'm filled with joy. The ghost killer. What's he doing? His job. Speeding wandering souls on their way, before they can be devoured by Yodoshi. Perhaps he sees Xena. Xena is alive! Do you understand? She is alive. I want to write a verse to express how I feel..., but there's no poetry of sufficient beauty. Akemi..., I've been in the underworld before, but it never felt like this. What's goin' on? Our bodies..., they're an illusion... projected by Yodoshi. While we are under his power... we must obey his will. Funny, you're just the way I remember you. I am at your service, Lord Yodoshi. You most certainly are. An eternity... of playing the whore to service my appetite for souls. Xena..., I was so worried that you wouldn't show Yodoshi respect. He's very dangerous. It wasn't respect I was showing him. I have a job to do. The job that you called me for. I'm going to destroy Yodoshi. It will be very dangerous. He seems to grow mightier with each passing day. You're going to have to trust me, Akemi. There's someone I have to meet... that can help us. You know you are being watched. Akemi, I can still hear your heart beating. And I can hear every one of Myuki's clumsy footfalls. She'll try to follow me. Let her. Shh. I saw something. The samurai may have Xena captive. We'll split up. - Xena. - Gabrielle. What are you doing here? I was so worried about you. I found your chakram. There's so much blood. I'm all right. What's with the robes? Gabrielle, I'm going to kill the Lord of the Dark Land. You'll need this. I can't take that. It's difficult to explain. You're dead. How could you let yourself be killed? I'm sorry, Gabrielle, I couldn't tell you. You'd have tried to stop me, and then we'd both be dead. Is that supposed to make me feel better? We've overcome death before. We will find a way to bring me back. But only by becoming a spirit can I kill Yodoshi and free those souls that I condemned to torment. Don't you see that? You're my whole life, Xena. I won't lose you. You won't lose me. Harukata, don't you come near her. Put down your weapons, Gabrielle. He's working with me. The anklet! With this, we can bring Yodoshi to us when we're ready. This is my soul mate. She's a poet like you, Akemi. I have one question. Would you risk your life... for the return of hers? Without hesitation. There is a way, Gabrielle. You must take her body, burn it..., then sprinkle the ashes into the Fountain of Strength on Mount Fuji. You must find the fountain before the second sunset after death. That's tomorrow. Harukata will say the incantations necessary... to give the sacred katana power against malicious spirits. Gabrielle. This is Akemi. It is an honor to meet you at last. And you, Akemi. Gabrielle can't help with our work in the tea house. She knows what she must do, and she should leave soon. Thank you. Wait. I would like to give you something... to protect you on your journey. Good luck, old friend. I am getting your body back, Xena, no matter where they have hidden it. Before sunset tomorrow, we will meet again... on the side of Mount Fujisan. See you there. Give me her head! I've been expecting you. Your friend was a fine opponent. She provided me with one of the greatest trophies an honorable samurai could ever claim. You call yourself honorable? You outnumbered her a thousand to one. You're not a samurai, you're a fraud. You couldn't've killed Xena unless she wanted you to. I think it's you with a death wish! I accept the challenge. Listen not just to the sounds..., but to what's behind the sounds. (behind the sounds.) It was the greatest honor of my life... to send Xena to an early grave. If I cannot do the same to you..., then I ask you... to grant me a noble defeat. Please, remove my head in one stroke. Good. Huh? Where is Miyuki?! Where is he? Duck! We finally meet, ghost killer. Akemi. Akemi. Akemi. Are you all right? Harukata, what went wrong? There is... only one explanation. He's drinking... from the Fountain of Strength on Mount Fuji. If you drink... from the fountain... and use... the sword I blessed..., it will be the final destruction... for any spirit. Xena..., my soul... will soon join the others..., trapped in... Yodoshi's grasp. You must finish a job... and release us all. I will not rest till it is done. I can't let you die. If I only had thirty seconds to live... this is how I'd want to live them..., looking into your eyes. Even in death, Gabrielle..., I will never leave you. You will return to me, my friend. Yodoshi a hawk? Even with his injuries, in bird form, he could make Fujisan in half a day. Yes, but he's weakened. We're no longer confined to these physical illusions. We could change into other vessels. What about them? Yes. Good. Xena. Gabrielle... is on her way to Mount Fujisan. And... if she succeeds... She'll succeed, don't worry. She's very good at what she does. I'm so sorry. Akemi..., what's wrong? I have to tell you... what must be done... to save those souls..., but I feel my own soul is doomed... for what I'm about to tell you. I know that you did what you thought you had to, Akemi. And perhaps by releasing those souls..., we'll all be redeemed. Come on. You'll come to regret not allowing me a warrior's death. It's not too late to put that right! I will not allow you to find the fountain... and revive your friend. No! No! No! Come on. Come on! What? My own daughter?! Akemi! Xena? Xena? Xena. Xena..., what happened? Told you I'd see you here. The Fountain of Strength... Get water... Fountain... Water... Gabrielle... Gabrielle, I need the sacred katana to finish the job. Thank you. The sun is setting, Xena. I have to find your ashes. - Gabrielle... - Come on! Gab... Enough of this! You are about to join the 40.000 souls you condemned, Xena. And the first thing I'll do... is take the head off your little friend with the tatoo. You won't live that long. I deserve the dignity of a warrior. Dignity, huh? Like you showed my friend? - Xena. - Akemi. You've redeemed me. You've redeemed them! - You've redeemed yourself! - Go in peace, Akemi. We'll meet again... one day. - No, Gabrielle. - Xena. - No. - Xena..., the sun is setting. - I have to bring you back to life. - No. Not if it means condemning the souls of the 40.000 who burned at Higuchi. - The souls are free. - They're free from Yodoshi's grasp. Akemi didn't wanna tell me this in case I wouldn't come back to help..., but for those souls to be released into a state of grace..., they must be avenged. I must stay dead. - But if I bring you back to life... - Those souls will be lost forever. Xena... That is not right. I don't care. - You're all that matters to me. - Don't you know how much I wanna let you do this? But if there is a reason for our travels together..., it's because I had to learn from you... enough to know the final, the good, the right thing to do. I can't come back. I can't. I love you, Xena. How am I supposed to go on without you? I'll always be with you, Gabrielle. Always. Xena. A life of journeying has brought you to the farthest lands..., to the very edges of the Earth. And to the place where I'll always remain: your heart. - So, where to now? - I think we should go south, to the land of the pharaohs. I hear they need a girl with a chakram. Where you go..., I'm at your side. I knew you'd say that.", "url": "https://subslikescript.com/movie/Xena_Warrior_Princess_-_A_Friend_in_Need_The_Directors_Cut-817532"},

I can not do nothing about it. Let me pay for it. I'm sorry, I am also that kind of people. I know, but do you have any choice? Everything there is smashed, do you have any money?

You must help him, or I won't treat you as my friend anymore. Don't go. Does he make any trouble? What the hell happened? It's all my fault. Not your prentice's business. Stop. Let me ask you a question,everyone. Such a stupid, no self-discipline student.. Should he stay here or leave us? What are you doing here? Get out? Dont have to miss him everyday. Soon, we'll be together. to the free world outside. I'm not looking for him, I'm looking for you. I hope you can teach me Xanda. Xanda?Impossible. I won't teach you. Leave? If it's because that I.. I did not honor you in the first place, I'll appologize now. I hope that you don't mind. Look at yourself. You wanna learn Xanda? Don't downgrade me. I hope you can just give me a chance. You really wanna learn? Can you suffer it? I can. I will follow your orders. OK,you can't smoke and drink here. I won't. You can't go out in daytime. You must keep early hours. I can do that. You can't fight outside. OK. And the most impotant thing is, you can't fall in love with anyone else. OK,No love. Qiang, I know what you're thinking. You thought that I dont wanna help Shrimp. You practice Xanda. Can you make money? There's something important at the end of this month. I've got to attend that match. You wanna attend the King of Newpeople Xanda Match? To be punched by others? Don't waste your life on it. I won't, it's better than owing money to someone else. Singing is for free, but where's the salary for working at the Bar? Why you only give me money for playing the drum? That 10 thousand yuan you owe me.. Not including the interests... If you treat me better. I'll treat you better. This is my room key, 2000 I think you'll understand. Whatever you say. Aren't you afraid if I told you to get outta here? I still owe you money,will you let me go? OK,put your right foot behind. Keep your fist tight. Stick your feet on the ground. Qiang, don't be angry with your fist cover. You wanna learn Xanda?Let me teach you. Just use whatever you can on me. Beat me, and you can go to that match. Your movements are too obvious. So there's too many signs, understand? Xanda is evolved from matial arts. The key is :fast,change and power. Lower part is too light. The spirit of Xanda is fight,not style. Change from passive to initiative. Knock out the opponent as fast as possible. It's not showtime now, it's useless to be goodlooking. Relax. Keep yourself agile. Brother,where have you been? Brother? What? I'm looking for you. I'm coming! Here you are. This is published today. It really can take us anywhere? It really can take us anywhere? What a shame,it can't go anywhere with me. No,you take it. It will take you to anywhere you want to go. It didn't say that. Let's go,I'll take you to the post office. Let's go and see the world. OK? Where? I don't know,I haven't been there either. The anti-smash ability of the red is quite strong. Now it's the third round. It seems that the throw attack of the black haven't made any threat to the red. Right. To be a sportsman,you must attend a match. To attend just 1 match is better than 3 months of practice. I have only 1 opportunity for the match this time. Who of you would like to go? I will. I've learned a lot here. Now I feel like having a real fight. So it should be me who attends the match. After all, I am a student here. You will give me a chance, won't you? Who else wanna attend? This fight is really wonderful. It is really hard to say now that who will win. A high kick,both side is on the ground. Is that Miss Liu? Is that Miss Liu? I am Zhang Guoqiang. Now I can give you back your money. It's your turn! Don't we have a deal? We should share the expense. Really? I thought you won't give it back. Now I'm going to a Xanda match. This is a good way to earn money. I'll have to go,it's my turn. It's also my turn. If I win the match,I can get more moneym. Then, I'll give them all back to you. Alright,let's see. Welcome back to the Guang Dong's King of Newpeople Xanda Match In the next fight.. the \"Ares of Light\" Zhang Guoqiang will show up. You shouldn't let Qiang attend that match. But it's OK,someone at his level fight in this kind of match.. he could learn much. This is \"the Ares of Light\", Zhang Guoqiang. There's an old saying: Heroes what they are when they are very young. We hope that Qiang could make a great coup in this match. Then let's see his opponent. His opponent is obviously more mature than him. \"Knifekman on the Volcano\",Four Last time I lose just because this bad boy? 2 meals, a week Be good. He is one of my two best men. The meal for the week.... Please don't make us pay.... All sportsmem pay your attention please. During match time, The use of head,elbow and anti-joint attack is forbidden. The hit on hindbrain,neck and crotch is also forbidden. Alright,please wear your teeth cover, let's get ready for the fight. The points Zhang Guoqiang loses in this round is very precious. The situation is no good for him. And he is in the disadvantageous position all the time. You see. With this fall, the Red will win by 3 points. Yes. A Si is now using his knees in the attack. This kind of attack won??t help him to win points according to the rule of the match. But it??s really effective in weakening the opponent??s defensive power. The Black??s counterattack doesn??t work at all. As you can see??he has lose his CG(central of gravity). I??ve heard about Zhang Guoqiang--that Champion of Striking Skills. He??s just so so in my eyes. But it is said that this Lightening Fighting Lord has once been a Champion of Striking Skills. Yes. I feel that this honor may be an obstacle for him to conquer mentally. But under the circumstance of actual combat, this kind of striking skill is just?? If he gives up now, he can only win half of the points. Stop? But you must promise me. When I pay the money back, you can??t deny to accept it. When I pay the money back, you can??t deny to accept it. Four Five 4?????? Now, the circumstance of the inside is that The referee is asking Zhang Guoqiang to have medical check immediately. If he hurts badly??the match should be stopped. It means that Zhang Guoqiang will lose the match. Zhang Guoqiang didn??t play well in this match. What do you think of his future career? I??m now getting more interested in his opponent-- A Si??s potential. Lost 3 points again! Stop? Give up now! I can??t bear watching it any more. Shame on you! Come back several years later when you have mastered good striking skills. Look??A Si??the Red is now starting his combined attack. Seems that Zhang Guoqiang can??t do any counterattack. Zhang Guoqiang fouls. Yes. He has used his elbow. The referee is warning Zhang Guoqiang. No, he just wants to deduct Zhang Guoqiang by 1 point. It seems that his name should be added to the list which shows the ones who have lost the most points in the free combat. Yes. He fouls again! He hit on his opponent??s afterbrain. He should lose1 point. If Zhang Guoqiang continue doing so, he may become the most points loss athletes in this match. I can??t agree with you any more. Why do you come here, auntie? I don??t mean that. You won??t let me to find him again, right? I beg you, auntie. You??d better learn from me. Be cooler. Please don??t talk, be a litter cooler. That??s my fee of this match. I??ll try to pay the left back to you soon. You forehead is still bleeding. Come in. Let me help to heal the wounds. You??ve hurt your hand? You??d better leave the adhesive plaster for yourself. Oh, wait, I don??t mean that. It is you who come here to help me voluntarily. I don??t know what I have done just now. Don??t ask me at first. Leave me more time, all right? Leave me more time, all right? Here??s the wound. Do you want me to help you to rub some medicinal wine? No, thanks. In case that you will hit me when you??re so close. I can try not to close to you. You, please. You won??t ring me, will you? I??m back to school now. We have strict rules. We can??t make girl friends. Do you know that you still owe me some money? I??ll certainly pay it back, don??t worry. As an athlete who majors in Wushu, We can??t see Wushu as our only aim. It is through learn Wushu, we learn a certain kind of spirit. Matches shouldn??t be used as a way of moneymaking. Don??t think that you??ve already mastered in Wushu Within only a few days. Wushu is a kind of self-cultivation. When we encounter frustration, we should learn something from it. According to your training level, you can??t hit the punch bag. Do some cleaning outside. Hey, coach, what on earth makes you always treat me like your enemy? This is my training style. If you can??t bear it, you can leave this school. Leave school? Leave which school? Have you taught me? Am I your student? Since I have been enrolled by this school, What on earth have you taught me? You say you??re a coach. Have you done what a coach should do? OK, I haven??t taught you any more. And I haven??t fulfilled my duty as a coach. These are what you??ve cognized? It seems that you cognition ability is so poor. Not better than a pupil. It really makes you uneasy to attend the match. If you want to continue you training program, you??d better do the cleaning. Clean all the building. Out? Yes? I??ll go there, coach. Cleaning. Coach, coach.. A Qiang got hurt. Can he have a two-days break? He??s just the person who should do the cleaning everyday until he changes his personality. Stop training! I won??t teach him Xanda, either. Coach. Enough, don??t bother me any more. I know that you don??t like me, I will leave here. A Qiang. Will he feel satisfied if I don??t train Xanda? But I won??t do the job free of charge. You owe me the fee. Good things with evil purpose. Dear audiences. What about you feelings? How time flies. It??s weekend again. Maybe it will make you much more clearer. To plan for the next week. Don??t miss, it??s shinning outside. What a cozy weekend! Just have a try and go abroad. Bask under the sun and breathe the fresh air. You can conquer all the difficulties in this week. To manage all the things. And have a look at you who just woke up. What else you haven??t done in this world? Is there a friend who is waiting for your calling? If so, you should pick up the phone as soon as possible. Dial the number. And say hello. How??s your feeling recently? Have you missed me? Have you thought of doing something else? Tell him that the Dawn Light Line hasn??t lied. I stay here waiting people to catch the Time Train together. Run to the first day of future, week Brother, why you treat me so good? Are you afraid of losing friends? Shit, I??m not like your type. Shit? You??re afraid of losing the match. You??re afraid of losing the match, and nobody will call you champion. They all leave you alone. You??re not so confident. Won??t you attend the match in the future? It doesn??t mean that you??re the champion forever. Have you heard that Afraid of defeat is also a defeat. Do you agree with me? Come back, A Qiang. Come back, Zhang Guoqiang. You lose. Who has beaten you? I beat you. Why you chose losing the match? Coz you have legs, but I have no choice. If you continue saying so, I??ll make you stay here forever. Actually, I can climb over it. Then, you will be defeated to a much more extent. Clothes have been washed. And I will leave these things here. I don??t care if you insist in returning them to me. Wake up. A Qiang? A Qiang. You son of a bitch? Get out! I think I can live happier in this way. I don't think that I look like my auntie. Thinking too much all her life. If you wanna go back home??do what you like. Wanna wander, the wander. Dangerous upstairs! If you want to say something, go downstairs. Let's talk about it clearly, I won't let you think too much. And you can't let me think too much, too. We both don't have to think too much. If you wanna go, To be freely, all right? O.K. But I won't change you. Change me? For what? For the time, if you can spare me a bit more time. Just a litlle is O.K. to me. But according to the other circumstances, it is most likely that the Red will win by several points. Please wait outside for the report.

And he is especially good at shocking hitting power. And he can master all the striking skills. And his throwing skill is second to none. And on the other side, Zhao Wei is especially good at defence. He can never be beaten. Through recent matches in 2 years, he has become the idol of all the audiences. Let's welcome Zhao Wei, King of the Tower. Ladies and gentlemen, let's start the match. It's a challenge match. Whether Tie Dalong will win or not, Let's just wait and see. The bell rings. Tie Dalong strikes fast. It's his first round strategy. Just like the old saying: Best defense is offence. I think that Tie will win more points than Zhao. Back. Actually, Tie also hits very fast. It seems that Zhao has realy meet a level opponent. But Zhao has never lost a match. Will this match change his undefeated history. Will the Legend of undefeated Zhao finished? Tie really plays excellent. Wow Defence, Tie. It seems that Tie didn't play well than before. Clearly lose something. What's the matter? Maybe something happened to him. Hold on, Tie! The referee didn't know, either. So he didn't stop the match. Tie, up you hands. Stand up, from now on, you fight with me. If you can't beat me, you won't have the chance to attend the match. We should have stopped the match. But it's too late. Tie has lost the match. Zhao can continue his undefeated legend. You lose! You lose, nobody will call you the Champion. Have you ever heard that afraid of defeat is a defeat? Actually I can climb over it. If so, you will lose badly. Tie I, you daddy, haven't taught you well. No, every match has the winner and loser. It is a challenge to attend matches. I've tried my best. I know, one will certainly be defeated if he continues fighting. And I'm a man, I can accept the result. And I, your daddy, won't let feel frustrated. Never give up, I think you'll win one day. I won't, silly boy. Coach I apologize for my misunderstanding you. Please train me again. You want to revenge for Tie? Traing shouldn't be aimed at certain people. I know, coach. If you think it through, get up at six next morning and go to jog. Don't mention it. You should mind your own business. I just want to prove that I'm not escaping the reality. Yes, you are not escaping the reality. But if so, what are you doing? I just want to tell myself I'm not a man who is afraid of defeat. Let me stand on the arena to face the real me. Give me another chance. O.K., tell me, how about me? What am I doing? I've told you that we shouldn't have thought too much. We don't owe each other. Remember? And you promised me that you would spare me much more time. You said it. I remember... Continue you dream of the champion, I do hope you'll succeed. I don't want to be a champion. I just want to change myself. You'd better do so, too. Do you remember Zhao Wei? I have once wanted to change him, but now... Feel freely... You are not like the type of your auntie. And you are not Zhao Wei, too. Do you know? Yes, I do. Tie, don't fight with me with only one hand. Heal the wounds, I'm waiting to train you. Just play it. Indelicacy? What? Why do you come here again? I come here to prepay you salaries. I'll pay back all the money I owe you in this month. What do you mean? I will leave Shenzhen. What's the matter? Quarrel with your boyfriend? If you don't have a boyfriend, I don't care be your boyfriend. I'd invite you to dinner with me. Do two jobs at the same time? Do you really need so much money? How much can you earn from that job? Mind your own business, what I do is none of you business. I'll pay back what I owe you. Do you want to leave this place which made you feel sad? Who? None of them. This matches last for 4 rounds. Zhao Wei still continues his undefeated legend. From this match, we can find that Zhang Guoqiang's striking skills are not so bad. I should tell that your wife has been pregnant for 2 months. You should be careful recently and come here to have checked oftenly. Ladies and gentlemen, It's the last match of the Xanda Arena Fighting Match. Who will be the champion of this match. I do think that all the audiences here and people sit before the TV are waiting for the answer Who will win? Which one? What's the matter recently? I've to have the match. When? Soon. Wish you succeed. Are you all right? O.K. Has anything happened recently? Has anything happened recently? Don't you have something special to tell me? Nothing, just want to leave Shenzhen for a while. Do you want to go to the Northeast of China? Don't worry, I'll write to you. When will you leave here? I'll take the 10-o'clock-train. Tomorrow? No, now. A Qiang, it's your turn. Do some warming up exercises. Be careful. The match will soon begin. The first one is the Red. He's the one you all know Undefeated Zhao Wei, King of the Tower. And the Black is a greenhand athlete. His name is Zhang Guoqiang, Lightening Fighting Lord A Qiang, A Qiang. What's the matter with you? Nothing. No matter what happened, you'd better set them aside, and focuses on the match, O.K.? You can do it. Teethproof??teethproof Set what things aside? I don't know. I'm not wrong. Stop? A Qiang, what have you done? I have no time. I'm sorry, coach. Athlete Start? This reporter has just asked Zhao Wei. It seems that he's so confident. He want to beat Zhang Guoqiang within 2 rounds. Only those who are really confident can say so. But as we can see from the history of Zhao Wei, it will happen absolutely. And we can also find that Zhao Wei never mind the points. His only goal is to knock the opponents off. It seems that Zhao will do the same to Zhang, too. What we interested is that whether Zhang can continue fighting. Stand up! The first round finished. And Zhang Guoqiang didn't play well. The second round will start soon. What we all waiting is that when Zhang Guoqiang will be knock off. But the performance of Zhang didn't so good as before. He didn't look confident. All audiences have seen that he is always watch the clock on the arena. What makes me feel that he is eager to wait for the end of the match. He hasn't have the confidence to win the match. Possibly. Don't worry, A Qiang. I can feel that you don't focus on this match. Coach. I want to give up the match. No, Coach. No, Coach. A Qiang, you should face the real you! Be careful. Athlete, Ready, Start. The hit of Zhang really works. He put down the shoulder of Zhao Zhao failed to throw Zhang. As we all see. Zhang's fall to the ground. It's a kind of Wushu Skill, called Wu Long Rao Zhu. Zhang Guoqiang is starting to show his striking skills. In my opinion, Zhao Wei is always using MuayThai's striking skills. Zhang's paces are special. You see this is Kong Fu. Stop? It seems that Zhang is a bit tired. And he's still watching the clock. Zhao Wei hasn't successfully kncok Zhang Guoqiang off in 2 rounds. He maybe not so satisfied with the result. It seems that the next round will be much more exciting. Don't worry, I'll insist. A Qiang, show what Tie and I have researched. You see this one Oh? This is what he defeated Tie Dalong. A Qiang. Flying Whirling Kick. Another! Zhang has won many points from these two kicks. The bell rings. Zhang stopped immediately. In the rules of the match. His polite behavior will help him win 1 point. Zhang is now a bit ahead of the match. But this still can hinder his tiredness. Look, he's tired! With this spirits he maybe defeated. Very likely. On the other side, Zhao Wei is getting more and more feocious. Actually, Zhao's defence ability is far more better than Zhang's Round 4 begins. It is certainly that they both have lost much energy. Zhang is still stand on the arena. But Zhao has also hit by many straight punches. But Zhao has also hit by many straight punches. Stand up, A Qiang Stand up soon, A Qiang! Four Stand up, A Qiang. Too much energy loss. As you can see, Zhao can still show his skills. Zhang is in an inferior position. It seems that Zhang will be defeated. Xiao Nue? Fanfan? Hello? It's you? How are you? I am at home, my hometown. Does your father still have you speciall training every night? The signal just now... The signal just now... I know. Where are you now? I'm searching a friend. She's a girl. I've heard that it was her who has changed you. Do you know where she is? When I was washing, I found a note in the pocket. Her name was on it. I come here to find her You konw her. I've seen her. Finally, I know why you chose not to escape the reality. Finally, I know why you chose not to escape the reality.

You're just a little sick. I promise I'll take care of you. Got that? I'll do whatever it takes. Mom and I already have a plan to fix everything. You know that, right? No matter what it is, I'll take care of you. Good let's get those shoes on. I got to get you a new pair. Supergirl was it? No, Superman, but Supergirl can be cool too, right? Dude, you got to stop listening to Jocelyn Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow! Okay. I need you to do a big favor for me. Can you be like Superman today for Mom? She's talking to the doctor right now how to get that kryptonite out of you. Can you do that for me? Good. Remember what Dad used to always say? He said being a hero comes from here. But let's be real. Superpowers can't hurt. You know, these were Dad's. Want to know what he told me about them? Whoever wore them is granted the powers of a superhero for a whole day. Nu-uh. It's okay if you don't believe me. It's still true. I don't believe you. I gotta go, little Frost. Remember, Sunday is our day, so plan something fun. Hey? Love you, Little Frost. I think we're all set. I still can't believe he would do that. We almost lost him, Joce. I'm sorry. I can't imagine finding him like that. I know it's been hard on you. I mean, who knows what he was thinking in that moment? Ya know, his mom was gone. We had great fathers, Tie, honorable men. Who knows where we would be if our fathers were anything like that horrible man. I don't know. Do you want to talk about it? No. Okay. So I was talking to your mom and she said that you're taking a pass on college? Joce, I don't want to talk about it. No. Tie, I think it's very honorable. Your dad would be proud. That's not it. What? I'm not going to college, and I'm not joining the military either. That's not funny. Tell me you're joking. You can't understand, Joce. Try me. Your family is well off. Titus, they're not paying for my school. You can get scholarships, loans if you have to. I know your grades weren't terrible. It's not that, okay? You just can't understand, Joce. Just let it go. Yeah, let it go, just like your future plans to make something of yourself. I'll be right out. Mom. I know. I thought we were in the clear. He really has this. He's so young. How could this happen? It's okay, Mom. The doctor said that it's treatable. I start work next week. We'll make enough. I know, Tie. I know. You better hurry up. They're waiting for you. Titus. Lucian couldn't have asked for a better brother, so thank you. All right. You guys ready? Yeah. Some of us are. Joce, can we not? Titus, this isn't a game. You need to wake up. You need to think about what you're doing. Can you guys stop fighting, please? Dude. Yeah. I'm sorry, Sonny. It's fine. It's just the shrinks kept trying to tell me that arguing can be healthy, but it just brings me back to a dark place when Bill used to- - I'm sorry, but at least he's gone, right? Nah. He's out there, somewhere. So... Check this out. You guys are going to love it Should we take them now? Shut your mouth. I've told you time and again not to speak unless you're told! Bane of my existence, you are. Sorry, Master. Captain, you were right. I saw the boy's mark with my own eyes. They're leaving now. The car is bugged. Excellent. Destination is obvious. Want us to follow just in case? Yes. It shall be done, Captain. Head out to the hills. Although, an expeditious stopover might be in order. I see dinner. Why do you cry? You were worthless, yet I've made you special. Can you not fathom the beauty you've created? Look. Look! Please, kill me. Why? It hurts so much. No. Pain does not warrant death. Back in your box. How much time does this one have left? A day or two before her painting is complete. Perfect. I'm nearly out of test subjects. Yes. A human cannot grasp the purpose of death. Perfect. Husband, what is this about? There is a boy who wears the mark. My dear, why must you do this, forfeit all that we've created? This is a mistake. What will become of me, of our children? Silence. Cain, do you not love me? Unacceptable. You dare question me? There will be no interference from you this time, Lillith. To forget who I am would be extremely unwise. No. I will go this time, Wife. Stop by the campground or stop by the falls first? Isn't the campground like six miles in? I'm not hiking in the dark. Don't worry. As men, we'll protect you. Get back here! Left the girl for you. Much obliged. Poor lass. Even your streets are no longer safe. You've got some fight in you. I like that. Oh, I wouldn't want to end up like him, would we? You're free to go. Ah, ah, ah, ah. Run. Thanks for the fire, Joce. Of course. Someone had to do it. Yeah. Good call. I know. Well, I'm going to go use the lake facilities. Ew. See? Lake water. Same things go on in the ocean, Joce. Titus, why aren't you doing anything with your future? I don't want to talk about it. Why not? You can't understand. Well, explain it to me. All right. Fine. You want to know why? Obviously. All right. Sit down. I don't want to. Whatever. Luke has got ALS, all right? Oh my god. Oh my god. The only way we'll have enough money is if I start working, now. You know, I'd love to go to school or join the military, but right now, my brother needs me. Do you even know what it's like, to have somebody you love dying right before you? Just this morning... He can't even tie his shoes, Joce, and this is just the beginning. It's not fair. Ah. You guys ready? What happened? Help me! Please! Please, oh my god, please! - Please, oh my god, please! - What's going on? Please, oh my god, please! - They're coming! - Who? - Who's coming? - Help me! Vampires! - What? - Oh my gosh. - Please, help me! - Hey, hey. - That's not... Stop... Stop- - JOCELYN: You people and- They're right there! Uh, guys. Would you like to know the purpose of a shadow? Shadows are a glimpse into the truths of the human heart, constructed to protect, yet never allowing for its carnal embrace. This is so stupid. I'm leaving. You're not funny. Without our shadows, the darkness would be set free. Once it's free, it slowly consumes all in its path till there's only one choice. Let's go! Let's go! Hurry! Come on, Sonny! Go, go, go, go! You cannot escape the dark. What is this place? I don't know, some abandoned factory or something. Why? You scared? Shut up. Crap. There's no service out here. Me too. Well... I'm not going back that way. Let's hide in here for the night. Damn. Okay. What the hell just happened? I don't know, but I'm about to find out. What website are you from?! - Joce. - What? Maybe she's telling the truth. No. Vampires aren't real. Maybe not. You got to admit, that guy- - What do I do? - What do I do? What do I do? What do I do? Crap! You all right, man? This isn't my bag. Ah! I must've grabbed the wrong one! Hey, dude, relax. I'm not crazy. Sonny, you grabbed my bag, so I grabbed yours. Have I ever let you down? I knew it. I knew I was right. I'll tell you guys something. They're not going to hurt anyone I care about ever again! Nobody! Dude, you're such a badass right now! Sonny, are you okay? You know this doesn't mean anything. Someone is just trying to scare us. That's all. Joce, I'm not losing it. I haven't felt this clear in a long time. I just want to keep us safe. Do you trust me? Of course! We both do. Good, now look. There's some important stuff in my bag that's going to help us fight these guys. See for yourself. A crucifix? And salt? But no matches? Why so much salt? It's more for ghosts, which can't hurt here. It's about preservation and purity. Just pour some unbroken lines across the perimeter. You know you're not going to win any awards as an actress? I'm on to you. You, you're going to answer some questions for me, but first, show me your teeth. You don't seem to be a vampire. How do you know the ones chasing you were? Did they drink blood? Did they have aversion to light? Did you ever see one turn? Well? They took me and my brother! They... They made him drink blood, and then, they killed him. And when he came back, he tried to kill me. They kept me in a box. They cut me and used my blood to paint. Please, make it stop. Make it stop. Do you remember his name? Was it Bill Cameron? I... I don't remember. It's fine. What's your name? Gentry. Gentry. That's a beautiful name. You've got us now. Don't worry. That's my boy, all grown up. Sonny is just being nice. Hey, Tie, I don't know what's going on here. Hey. I just want you to know how sorry I am. I was such a jerk, and- - I know. Thinking you were blowing off your future. I should have known that something was up, and I am so sorry about Luke. I know. Tie. He's so young. I keep saying how sorry I am, but I really am. If you need anything... I love you, Joce. What did you say? Sonny: Guys, there's something out there! You cannot escape the dark. Titus! Enough. You should not have run. Enjoy yourselves. Titus! How's my acting now, bitch? Hey, Sonny, I do know a Bill. Gentry! Get back here! Gentry! Probably not the time to tell you your salt wasn't worth a damn! They're vampires, not ghosts! I'll kill you! Sonny! You're mine! I'll be back for you. You're not going to be pretty when we're done with you. There's nowhere to run. I knocked a lamp over, so the floor is covered in propane. I smell nothing. I will burn this place to the ground. What is that? Go. What the hell? Who are you? Girl, did you do this? Hey, I'm talking to you. I said, \"Answer me!\" You're in my way, child. Too bad. Listen to me! She is mine! Now! That slut is mine! Answer me! Jasper. Rosalie. What? We don't know you, right? Rosalie? We most certainly do not. Explain yourself. My master is your god. No. I am your god. - No. I am your god. - No. I am your god.- Hey! You ain't my god! No. I am your god. Hey! You ain't my god! Are you going to kill us, too? No. Now get out of my way. What do you want? You can't understand. No. He's done nothing to you. Leave him alone. No. Just leave him alone! You will fall asleep now. He .. will... die... if... you... don't- I know. Why should I let you die? Answer my question. I don't know. To stop disappointing you? No, but you might be on the right chord. What can death provide that life cannot for someone in your position? Back in your box. Enter and speak. Patrol found her near the entrance. Long walk from the factory. Surprised she's alive. Leave her. You risked my apprentice, Husband? Use your spirit magic and view her memories. With pleasure. Your magic fascinates me, my dear. What happened? Such darkness. How is this possible? Explain. He's a child of yours. No. His presence is more kin than child. He is you, but more? Me but more. Intriguing. He killed them both so quickly. No matter. We're at the end. Do you have what we need? Of course. But what of this intruder? We can't dismiss his presence so quickly. He wants the boy. Shut up, human. His presence seems rather formidable. Perhaps he desires your master's power. No. I believe him to be a traveler. When you alter the boy's memories, make him see the intruder in my place. Certainly, my love. Free to leave, Jocelyn. Friend not dead. Are you talking? Yes. What is going on? What is this thing? What are you doing to him? Who are you? Where's Titus? I don't have time for this. Rude, Xane. I'm not thing, Jocelyn. How do you know my name? Watch her. Where are you going? That's none of your concern. Wait! Xane not good with people. Can't blame. Been 10,000 years. 10,000 years? What are you? From future. I'm... a... spirit almost... gone... now. Oh. What's wrong with you? Dying vessel holding life force. Damaged. Have hope now. Sonny! What's wrong with him? Is he going to be okay? Sonny is vampire now. What? This has got to be a nightmare. Why is he chained up? Newborn vampire. Dangerous. Precaution. Stop from attacking you. And the news just keeps getting better and better. Newborn attacking you good news? 10,000 years in the future and you're telling me sarcasm doesn't make it? That's it. I've officially lost it. Ah. Sarcasm. Ha ha ha. Xane not partake. Your buddy who stormed out of here? You don't say. Where's Titus? Is Mr. Personality coming back? Why didn't he kill us? So many questions. Xane right about you. Conserving strength. Goodbye. You've got to be kidding me. Hello, Mother. Hello, my dear. Lay down. Be still. Enough. You should not have run. Enjoy yourselves. Jocelyn? Sonny? Gentry? You will fall asleep now. When you awake, you'll remember all you've witnessed to be true. You will not be sad or cry or carry on. You will be strong, and angry. The memory should hold easily. Will that be all for today? - Will that be all for today? - Yes, Gentry. Will that be all for today? That will be all for today, probably for a while. Mother, are you not pleased? You care about my husband, love him as you love me. I would do anything for the both of you. Yes. I feel that. I'm going to tell you the truth. Your father longs for death. But he can't die. Unfortunately that's not true. If he's slain by a vampire of his lineage on the tetrad, he can die. This boy is of that lineage. How can you know? All of your father's lineage bear a mark, this mark. The blood moon happens in two days. For the past 1,000 years, I've sought out and eliminated all who bore the mark of Cain, and somehow this boy still exists. I've rightfully protected my husband from death two times, but he grows increasingly impatient with my interference. Admittedly, I fear what he'll do when he finds out I'm... Nevermind that. My child, if I can't change your father's mind before the night of the blood moon, you must run away with the boy. If the boy is the problem, let me slit his throat! I'll do it gladly! As pleasurable as that would be, your father is linked with him. He's practically immortal. Mother, take these. Use them! Use the knife and the ring! Use them to control Father until after the blood moon, and then he'll be safe! Mother, please! Don't ever mention that dagger ever again. It holds the darkest of magic. And using it to control your father would be an unforgivable betrayal. I'm sorry, Mother. I'll never betray you again. Gentry, make the boy trust you. Through the boy, that is the way. Mother? When are you going to turn me? Will the girl do it? She is inquisitive, but she will do as she's told. You have great faith in one so... insignificant. Don't underestimate that one. When I found Gentry, she was bathing in the blood of her parents. She's cut from my cloth and therefore exceedingly capable. What do you make of the intruder? I'll be speaking with the Captain shortly. Thank you, Henry. Aye. I know you're not asleep. Do you have a name? Called Frost. Ha! Got you. No. Bored. Pretty person chat with. So you'll answer some of my questions? In it for me. Well, what do you want? Another friend. I can do that. You've lost leverage. Wouldn't you answer a question for a friend? Smart. Only allowable questions. Okay. Where's Titus? Who attacked us and what do they want with us, and who are you and Mr. Personality? I can only answer about Titus. I must go back to the beginning. Cain is known as the world's first murderer. He's the son of Adam and Eve, older brother to Abel. When God favored Abel's offering over Cain's, Cain grew increasingly angry until one day he lured his brother to a field and killed him. God, of course, knew right away what he had done and marked him for eternity. Cain was then cast away from all he had known and left to wander the Earth aimlessly. And, because the Earth would no longer yield to him, he was forced to live off the blood of man. He became a vampire, cursed and immortal. Later, Cain met and married Lillith. Before turning Lillith, they had a son, Enoch, who also bore the Mark of Cain. No one understood the mark's power at the time. It was just a mark, or at the most, a reminder. When Enoch grew, he married and had children, and as Cain and Lillith's lineage continued on, each firstborn son carried the Mark of Cain. It wasn't until many centuries later that Cain discovered the mark represented a potential escape from the unending curse. You see, on the first lunar tetrad, he was wounded and almost killed by another vampire who bore the mark. It was then that Cain realized he could die. Lillith did everything she could to prevent Cain's death by tracking down and eradicating all who were unlucky enough to bear the mark. She thought herself successful until one day Cain found Titus. Now, Cain has taken Titus and will force him to end Cain's suffering through death. Titus taken? Where did you get that? What? It's none of your business. No. I don't suppose it is. Those chains should hold. This will quench his thirst if he awakens. I thought we just give him blood. He'll need more soon. In his weakened state, Frost cannot protect you. When Sonny awakens, feed him. Come, Gentry. We have business to attend to. Joce? It's okay, sweetie. I'll be back. No. This shouldn't happen yet. Frost, keep her safe. Great. But I can do it. I promise. I know. I know I missed a few days. My son had to go to the doctor. Please. Please, please, please. I need this job. Please. Hello? Hello? Hello? It's okay, Mom. I have this, or I can find a job, too. I've seen lots of kids throw away soda cans, so I can collect them. You're such a good boy. I'm not kidding. Tie, he gave me these. He said I can be like Superman for the whole day. I could. I can save the president, and he would have to reward us. He would. But you know, how about we save these for a time when we really need your superpowers, okay? We're going to be fine. Coming! Luke, can you go get your bath ready, okay? No, I can't. Okay. I'll be right there, okay? Coming! Frost, what can I do? What do you mean? How am I supposed to help? Can't just sit here all day. It's so bright. Sonny? Blood ready now. Joce? Do I give it to him? Set in reach. Let me out! I'm so sorry. He jumped at me. Please don't. Sonny, are you okay? No please Sonny. It's okay. You have to stop yourself. Please. Sonny! Frost? Friend. I'm so sorry. Sonny broke the chains and Frost saved me. I'm so sorry. I was just so clumsy. It's all my fault. It's all my fault. No. I underestimated the timeline. It's all changed because of my arrival. No. Mrs. Frost. No! You monster! Please don't hurt the boy! Please don't hurt the boy! I've got superpowers! Forgive me. How could you! Let me be, child. - Let me be, child. - Let you be! Let me be, child. You want you to let you be like you let them be? I didn't. You did! Where's Luke? What did you do to him? Where is he? I didn't hurt them. - I didn't hurt them. - Liar! I didn't hurt them. She is right there I would never hurt them. It's me, Jocelyn. Frost didn't tell you the whole story. When I killed Cain all those years ago, I inherited a curse seven times worse than death, and with no one left bearing the mark, I will never die. My rage at this fate, including the loss of all I have loved, caused me to turn into the monster you see before you. I stepped into Cain's walk and helped the world close in on itself. No human, vampire, or animal was safe from my wrath. Finally, there was nothing left, and in silence, I waited. I would've stayed insane if not for Frost. He came up with the idea of coming back and stopping myself, stopping Titus from killing Cain. The calculations were like finding a needle in a haystack, but somehow, and just barely, we made it. This is the end. We have finished. It's beautiful. Yes. Now it's time for you to join Lillith. It's going to get very painful. But I think I know the answer. Do tell. The only thing death can provide me is freedom. I want to be free. You may now free yourself. Thank you. Well, that's a pity. I wanted her. To die in dust. Death shall all the world subdue. How I envy her. Yes, Husband. Do you remember the view from the Eiffel Tower, or our private gondolas in Venice, our evening walks through Amsterdam? So many memories. And yet, not as many in this country. But it is so new. Imagine what we could do here. End mankind, or allow it to continue, an entirely new adventure for you and yours. Cain- - Dispose of Gentry. The tetrad draws near. Must we do this? Her purpose has ended. My love, she has further purpose, I can assure you. Explain. She is my vessel into the boy's mind. There will be memories yet to alter. Plus, this boy, your boy, is fond of her. He considers her a friend. She will convince him to do our bidding. My bidding. Yet you've reasoned well. Can you accomplish this? Of course, Husband. I will make her irresistible. Lillith. This tetrad is my last. Do not stand against me. Promise me. You have my word I will not stand against you, but that girl is mine. I will be back for her. Why must he speak of Gentry? Perhaps he wants your focus on the little things. If you're happy with a small victory, you may leave the big one alone. He is mistaken. Why must he do this? He's been walking this Earth a right long time. No longer than I, and I want nothing more than to be here with him. His crew is not giving up on their captain. There's still hope. Even the tiniest of lights can pierce the dark. That's what I'm afraid of, Henry. So what's the plan to save Titus? We should wait for Jocelyn to awake. I won't to explain myself twice. Finally. Tomorrow night, I will kill Cain and free Luke and save Titus from ever becoming this monster. My loved ones will be able to live on, no matter what form of life that takes. Your loved ones will live on? What about you? I have lived for thousands of years, ruled this very world, and was its end. Only I remained. I tried to die a thousand times. After the anger dissipated, a giant void took over. It wasn't loneliness I felt, but rather deep and utter emptiness. When Frost came to me with hope, I realized I had been lacking the most important thing of all, something even Cain had managed to have throughout his journey. I lacked love. Sonny, Lucian, my mother, and you, Jocelyn. And me what? I should not say. You kidding me? - You kidding me? - I do not joke. I do not joke. You said you'd anser my questions so answer them Jocelyn, as a boy, it was no secret to anyone around us. I was deeply infatuated with you. But what they didn't know is that it ran much deeper than that. Through the years, I tried to replace those feelings with others, with anything. Yet, after a thousand lifetimes, you've never left my heart. Even in the end, all we are is what we remember. Jocelyn, I'm sorry if I said something you didn't want to hear. I don't know what I wanted to hear. What do you mean? I've waited a really long time for Titus to figure out how he feels about me. And last night before Cain took him, told me that he loves me. I know. He never got your answer. Do you? Yes. What happens when you kill Cain if Titus doesn't? Will you cease to exist? That's one possibility. What if you both disappear? What if... What if you and Titus are exactly as you should be? I'm an abomination. I shouldn't exist. If that's true, then Sonny and I are abominations, too, because we wouldn't be here if you hadn't come back. So should we not exist? Jocelyn should always exist. Okay. Then... Maybe we should let Titus fulfil his purpose I know that we're still going to have to be there to grab Luke, but- - You'd join me? Of course. I mean, you're Titus, too. No, I'm not. You're but a child. It's not as simple as that. Life isn't this fairytale. You, Lucian, and even Sonny will all die one day. I can't protect you forever. So we'll find another way. There's always a way. No. No one can survive. So you're not even willing to try? It's pointless. - You're wrong! - There is no hope. No, you're wrong! You say that it's pointless, but we need you. We all need you. You're the only one who knows what the future holds, and you're the only one who can stop whatever it is that's going to happen, and you're the only one who can help alter it. Jocelyn, I forgot how smart you are. Did I change your mind? No one can. Then this isn't over. I'm not going to let you die. I won't let either of you die. Hello? Hello? Let me out! Gentry? Yes, it's me. I don't know what's going on. Why am I locked up in here? We were attacked by vampires, Gentry, vampires. Yeah, and they saved us. I know, but where are they? You were just out there with them. Yeah. I don't know. They've given me a small amount of freedom while you heal. Whatever. I'm leaving. Ah. Get out of my way. Just wait. They're coming. Besides, they wanted me to come in here and wait with you. Fine. I don't know how much longer I can just sit here. They took Luke and killed everyone. I can't even think straight. They said they tried to save them, but they were too late. I'm so sorry- - I'm going to kill him! Don't worry. You'll get your chance. Who are you? I am called Cain. And when I speak, you will listen. One of my children has taken a particular interest in you. It may seem strange but you alone possess something very special. The mark upon your back is God-given and holds a sacred power. Because of this, it's the target he's after, and unfortunately, only you can stop him. How do I kill him? In two days' time, a great event takes place on the blood moon, the tetrad. It's happened only four times in history. If I were to turn you into a vampire on that day, you would become a god powerful enough to do just that. Two days' time, boy. Think on it. I know it's a lot to take in. I just don't understand. Why did they kill them? I know. But we'll make them pay for it. What are you talking about? I don't even know you. You're just some weak little girl. Shut your mouth! I've been through more than you'll ever know. I watched as the life drained out of my parents' eyes that night, and it was... terrible. I know we lost your friends, so forgive me if maybe I don't want that to happen to your brother too. Gentry. You know nothing about me. Wait. Damn it! Hello, my boy. It's a pleasure to meet you. Where's my mom? I want to be with her. Ah. Of course. Well, unfortunately for you, your mother has been marooned, indefinitely. I've brought you some food. I'm not hungry. No? I just want to go home. What are those? Nothing you need to concern yourself about. May I suggest eating a little so you can keep up your strength? I suspect you're going to need it. Okay. Sink me, boy! Always clumsy, Steven! Steven? I'm Luke. I'm sorry. Aye. I suppose you are. I can't eat meat like that. It's not cooked. I don't suppose you can. I'll have Maggie cook up something a little bit more palatable, Luke. Hello, daughter. Mother, this bag of flesh doesn't trust me! I can see it in his beady little eyes! I just want to gouge them out! I've come to fix that. But I thought love spells didn't work. They don't. I've decided to switch out the memories of the one he loves. She seems to be the only one he trusts completely. From now one, your name is Jocelyn. Our meeting is about to take place. Jocelyn, go behind that rock and do not leave for anything. Is that understood? - Fine. - I need to prepare. Whatever. Come on, Sonny. Joce! I'm sorry for yelling. I just don't understand. I thought you were dead. Then I didn't recognize you? I just can't believe it. You're alive. Of course, silly. Cain saved me too. But you've been all out of sorts lately. It's hard losing loved ones. I've been out of sorts myself. So tell me, why do you get to go in and out but I have to stay? Because they know I would never leave you. Besides, I'm not the important one here. You are. You have a very important choice to make. You know me, Joce. I'll do whatever it takes to save my brother. And that's why you're my favorite. I'm you're favorite, huh? Since when? What? In the mood for yet another drudge, my queen? Now you've done it. I've lost my appetite, even though little Margaret is quite precious. Well, Maggie is quite useless to me now. What is it you want, Henry? I've had some time to observe, and your... witchery is making me uneasy. Hmm. You've had time to spy? No need. Gentry performs perfectly. It's almost time to initiate part two of the plan, in which your assistance is no longer required. But then again, Henry dear- - Yes, Your Majesty. Clean that thing up. Maggie, do you think you're worthless? You'd be wrong. Your queen soon comes with a trick. Of course she does. Have you taken care of the child? Luke? He's sequestered. He has a name already? Perhaps when you're through with this business you'd like a new pet. That won't be necessary. My presence has been requested by that vampire. Do you want me to take care of this situation? Interesting. He's been protecting the boy's two friends. Go ahead and tell your men I want them dead, but leave the traveler to me. It shall be done. Captain Henry Every. I'm tired of playing this game, Captain. It's time I got some answers, now. Yes. Come along, boy. You want to know why I picked you as my apprentice, yes? I murdered your king. It makes no sense. I had a son once. You had a son? Do you want to hear or not? I'll shut up. Yes, I had a son once. Not of my blood, but of my spirit. Steven. We were brought together by a mutual love of the open sea. Even when he was just a cabin boy, he had better sea legs than most of my crew. Sure was a clumsy lad, always knocking over his plates. He had that light in his eyes. Maybe Cain saw it, too. I still don't understand. When he summoned for the boy, I couldn't refuse. I told Steven to do as he was told. They came to this very place that night, and I was too late. Arrived in time to watch Cain rip the heart right out of his chest. You remind me of Steven. Plus you killed that bastard Cain. I thank you from the bottom of all my black heart, I do. How may I be of service, old chap? I swear, if this is just some ploy to get me to shut up- - No. Something is out there. Bill? What? No. That's not him. Bill! Hello, son. Bastard! Sonny, don't do it. Get back here! For my men are hungry, stout, and resolute, and should they exceed my desire- I cannot help myself. You're the boy. I had a feeling you'd know. What is it you want? I will kill Cain again. To what end? To save myself from what I've become. The result will be the same for you. You know of my plans? Yes. You desire his throne and my support as your apprentice. I've lived it once. But on the night we enslaved mankind- - Captain, Master is ready for you. Hello, Imitator. Today is the day. Why don't you just kill me already? You threaten me enough and take away the only friend I've ever had. I should kill you, and I probably will. You're the only piece I have left of Steven. Then why do you hate me so much? I don't hate you. I hate what you're not. No! I have to stop you! I will! No! I will get out! I will not lose you! Kneel and be crowned. I, King, do knight thee as fellow king of our people. Xane! - What is this? - What's going on? Xane, dagger, betrayal. Henry- - Henry- - What? Henry- - He's lying! - Enslave! You! He's finally broken down. Reveal all at once. Your life depends on it. It was under his orders, sir. No. They're all lying! This is mutiny, conspiring against both of us! Haven't I always treated you like a son? Remove your gloves. My gloves? Don't play me for a fool. I know this dagger. Can you blame a mate for trying? Yes. I can. Well, maybe this time, the old has passed away. And the new has come. Find your light, Henry. Hello, Frost. Frost? That's not my name. Who are you? You killed the Captain. The one who kills your master becomes your new master. Is that correct? Well, maybe. Yes. Join with him. What? Ew. No. That's incest. I command you. I despise you. I know. What are you waiting for? Can I get some privacy? You're in big trouble now. The boy is mine. I have a job to finish. Leave him alone, Bill. Haven't you done enough? This is the worthless boy I told you about always running to his mommy. Well, that is, until I killed her. And this is his girlfriend. I'll kill you! That's a good one, Sonny. I should've finished you the night I drained your mother. Too bad Cain's golden boy showed up. Wish it would have been your girlfriend. Bet she would have been even more fun to drain then mommy eh? I guess we'll find out! No! Get Off! Not my day, eh? Helpless, and of course, you always were. Let me knock your mother around while you hid in your bedroom. But that's okay, because we both know that she liked it. Don't you dare talk about her! Oh no. What are you going to do? Nothing, right? Just like that night. You're going to stand there and do nothing, aren't you, son? Sonny! Get up, Sonny. Let's end this. Leave him alone. You don't just get to handle this, Tie. I'm not Titus, Jocelyn. You're bleeding. Am I going to turn now? No. You must drink from the one who bit you. Good. I'd rather die then be like one of them I didn't mean that. Your wounds need attending to. May I help you? No, no. I don't need your help. Wait. What's wrong? That bastard is torturing Luke! No, no, no! Wait! Look. I heard them talking earlier, but I don't know if I should say. What? Tell me. Cain's wife said that he's been lying to you. If you become a god, you can't save Luke. Yeah, but I would have to to save him. She said that he'd been using you. He wants to use you to kill his competition. If you become a god, Luke dies. That can't be right. Are you sure that's what you heard? Titus. What are you doing? I know your angry, but is your revenge more important than your brother's life? No. Do you trust me? But what- - Have I ever led you astray? No, ma'am. What are you doing? Henry has not returned. I thought I'd serve you your port tonight. Yes. Henry's absence can only mean one thing. And what is that? You've plotted against me, Wife, but you've failed. That vampire is my boy from the future. I succeed tomorrow. My love- - Did you think I would not know? Please forgive me, Husband. You know it was bore from a place of love. Yes. No matter. At this final hour, let us rejoice. My freedom is inevitable. The curse will soon fall from my shoulders. Very well. Let us celebrate our last night together, Dear One. I know you, Lillith, too well. Let this end tomorrow. A wise woman knows when she's been outwitted by her betters. Here's to us. A match made in hell. Do you know where to take him? Yes, Mother. She's not coming with us? I must keep Cain distracted. Mother, I... Now go. Quickly! Come on! You've disappointed me, Lillith. What are you doing? I don't know. Just looking at some old scars, I guess. You know, Bill wasn't always such a bad guy. For a while there, I thought... I thought he really loved my mom. And then, he changed. Yes. He was turned by someone, probably Henry, and eventually became the worst part of himself. Is that what's going to happen to me, too? I mean, I can already start to feel myself changing. I killed people yesterday. Is that what you meant when you said you understood the decay in my heart? There was a time I would have said yes, but being here now, I'm not certain. You were different from Bill before. Perhaps, should you choose, you'll be different from him now. So what's the answer? Some might say forgiveness. I understand its difficulties, though. Morning. I take it we're still going through with the plan? We'll head up beyond the hills. It should only take a few hours. - It should only take a few hours. - Okay. It should only take a few hours. Well, I still think that you're wrong, so I will just have to convince you otherwise on our way there. Master, we couldn't find them. We won't stop looking. Should I send out more patrols or- - Contact no other house. Summon Lillith's children to my lair. I have a reward for you all. So, who did you meet yesterday? I met a man Who had the present version of Frost with him Frost! This guy just gave him to you? A corpse has no choice. He'll soon be back to his old self. So... you just take what you want and kill without care? Yes. As I said before, I'm a monster. No, Tie. Xane. I think I'm going to be sick. So, how many people have you killed? All of them. That's nice. Hey, do you smell that? No. Who did this? Bill. He's there. I couldn't resist in partaking. I only have business with my stepson. Your business involves me now. Tie, no! You need to end this, now. It's just you and me, kid? Think you've got some balls now? I doubt it. Got a fresh haircut. We can have some fun with that girl of yours. You make me sick! See? No balls! You were worthless as a kid, and you're worthless as a vampire. Change in plans. Take me to a hospital. You're going to miss your meeting. Guess I win. Joce, I have to do this. No, no, no, no. You can't turn me. Promise me. Promise me. Tie. Welcome, my children. Today, you will receive the greatest gift of all, your freedom. I hope you realize this is your doing. I get no pleasure from this. Run! Why, Cain? You should not have tried to deceive me. But yes, I do remember our time together. They will be my last thoughts. But it's time for me to find peace. Goodbye, my love. We're almost there. It's right past this ridge. Joce. Joce. Jocelyn! Oh, right. What? I just... I'm just really glad you're here with me. Ah. There'll be time for that after we save your brother. Okay? All right. See it? There it is. Thanks. So, how do you know he's in there? There's only one way to find out. I don't see anyone. He said he would be here! My head. What's going on? We should get out of here right now. No. We cannot walk away. Kiss me. Joce, what are you talking about? I said, \"Kiss me.\" Rest well. What? Who's... I can't... Well done, Gentry. You've pleased me. It is my pleasure to serve you, Master. Are you fond of this boy? No! He disgusts me. Sounds like a match. With your newfound abilities, together you would dominate the world. I will now fulfill my end of the agreement. After I turn you, wear this, and as long as the dagger remains in Lillith's heart, her power belongs to you. I'm ready, Master. When is she going to wake up? I need to wash all this blood off me. Stop asking that. She should awaken at any moment. I heard she might not be too happy, though. Hello, friend. It's so bright. It's not going to be like that forever. My throat. It burns. Joce. Jocelyn, I can assure you this was all done for the best. Why? I didn't want it, not like this. I know, and I thought about that, and I tried to stop him, but he showed me. It was like the light was leaving your body. I couldn't even imagine. Did you turn me? No, no, no, like he'd even let me if I wanted to. Did you want to? No, no! That's not what I meant. Shh. You're too loud. Where is he? So is he hiding from me? Joce, don't. Joce, you're not as tough as you think, you know? Frost, it's nice to see you again. Where is he? What? I can't tell you. That would defeat the whole purpose of everything. You're wrong. Everything has changed. I'm sorry. I would never betray a friend. Frost, what happens when the person who changes you dies? You die too, right? Yes. Xane changed Sonny and I. So what happens when he dies? I could lose all my friends. He's at the ritual grounds. It's to the east. Welcome. I'm glad you made it. I believe it's time that we met. I assume you're the reason Henry Every never returned. Leave the child alone. What child? This child? Do not harm him. I have no choice. I must harm him to get what I want. I need no incentive to kill you. I wouldn't do that. If I sever the boy's head, he'll be gone forever. Why do you oppose me? This is your moment of freedom. Stop! If you touch the boy again I will sever your head Such anger, but your presence in this timeline has woken my appetite. Why must life do this, at the moment of my deliverance present a challenge of my equal? You are nothing compared to me. Can you feel it? We're on the brink of death, of freedom. I know you understand. You've been trapped, imprisoned in this life. No! This life is a gift. You lie to yourself. Such weakness. \"Such weakness,\" says the one hiding behind a child. Let fate decide who goes free. Fate cannot stop me. I feel alive again. You can't beat me. You forget, boy, I am the original. Witness my true form. You are no match for the truth. I am truth. No! Don't! We end this now, like before. No! Our battle has just begun! You've given me a reason to live. Titus, it's okay. - It's okay. - I will rid this Earth of everything you hold dear. - No, no. Hey! - Luke! Titus, wait! Titus, we have to go! Titus! Until the day- No! - What? - Stop! You're next. Titus, I failed. What? Sonny, we need to get to Lucian and cauterize his wound, but I need you to keep an eye on Jocelyn while I do. Wait! Joce, wait! Stop me. No! How is she so strong? - Stop! - Help me! I can feel it. What am I? I'm going to kill you. You're nothing! Thought you could take my family and get away with it! Joce! Sonny, do something! He needs her! Joce, help me! Pathetic. You don't even fight back. You're nothing in the presence of a god. Sonny! He needs her! Joce! Xane, help me. You may have the power of a god, but you lack the understanding. Here. Bite. Go to Lucian, please. Okay. Is Titus going to be okay? Yes. That type of wound cannot kill him. How could I even think about hurting Luke? Newborns have great difficulty controlling themselves. You'll soon learn to overcome your cravings. Why did you turn me? Always full of questions. Joce, I had no choice. Allowing your light to extinguish was unacceptable. Looks like history repeats itself. Yes. I failed. No. No. Don't ever say that, and don't you ever give up on me. Why? Xane, Lucian will be fine. I disinfected and cauterized the wound. It missed anything major and his vitals are all at an acceptable range, but he'll need medical attention as soon as possible. Good. Get him to a hospital. I'll take care of these two. Sonny, today would have turned out much differently had you not been here. Thank you. Do you still thirst, Jocelyn? No, I feel better. Good. We should leave. Xane. Yes. Promise me you will never leave me, you'll never give up. Why? Because I need you. I need both of you. Xane. Promise me. I promise. Hey. Can we give that to him? He needs time, Joce. Time? For what? Time for what? Healing isn't easy. I know. Hey, Joce. Oh, thank you. I'm starving. Do you remember when we used to eat real food? Your mom made the best lasagna. Yeah. Those were the good old days. I missed you, Joce. I can tell when you're lying. I'm sorry. All the memories are there, but your face isn't the one I see. It's fine. Hey! Wait. When am I going to see Luke? I'm flying out to get him tomorrow. Actually he's feeling a lot better. Wouldn't it be better if Sonny went? I mean, he knows Sonny. He knows me, too. Sonny is staying here with you. You're more comfortable with him, but that just means I get to go and bring home my favorite Frost. Okay. Thanks, Joce. Of course. How'd it go? That well, huh? I need to go get some air. I wish I could have heard her one last time or seen the light shining in her eyes. I missed her by a minute. Can you go back and try again? No. That was my only chance. You saved both her sons. I know. How's Titus? He's safe, which is what matters. You have something on your mind. I have memories on my mind. Why are your memories different than Titus's? It's the flow of time. My mind has had thousands of years to unweave itself. I remember you telling us once that all we are is what we remember. You remember me. He doesn't. He will. And I will not forget. I have no map or memory for this either. But you, Jocelyn, are my North Star. You know, sometimes, I really miss you, Mother. Sometimes. Hello, my love. Joce? Of course, silly. I can't take this anymore. I'm about to break. I'm coming for you. Hurry.", "url": "https://subslikescript.com/movie/Xane_The_Vampire_God-9515732"},

[Female Announcer] Dr. Martin to admissions, please. (knocking at door) Come in. - Hi, Dan. - Hello, Harry. Susan Jeremy, this is Dr. Saxon. - Hello. - Hello. Dan, would you take a look at these for me please? She's Dr. Jacobs' patient, but you could handle it just as well, I suppose. Me? Why? Well, it's kind of urgent. Dr. Jacobs send you here? No, not exactly. Just read it, will you, Dan? What are you doing, Harry? You hustling? I don't need any more patients. All right. This is it. Thanks. - See you around. - Okay, thank you. Sit down.

But this whole check-up is just a - A what? A simple formality. I've been promoted and I just need some sort of medical certificate for my new insurance.

[Female Announcer] Dr. Beam, please report to the fourth floor. Dr. Beam, please report to the fourth floor. (ominous music) - Dan. - Dr. Beam.

Here you are, Dan. Did you read it? - Just glanced through it. - Let's see it. Doesn't make sense. On the contrary, it's quite explicit. The symptoms are all wrong. In fact, the symptoms are totally non-existent. Symptoms? Remember that cowboy in ward 117? All his symptoms indicated he had acute hepatic infection. And it turned out to be mumps. Christ, this is practically a fucking death warrant. Suzy, wait 'til... Hmm. (door creaking) (Nancy screaming) Somebody, anybody, help! Oh, they killed Suzy! I don't know what's happened. They killed Suzy! (Nancy gasping) (killer groaning) (bones cracking) (dramatic music) Well, I'm afraid we're gonna have to keep you here for a while. - Why? Some discrepancies in the tests. - But... - We'll have to keep you under observation for a few days. - Is it serious? - No. It's nothing. You can tell me the truth. Is it serious? Yeah. It might be. (dramatic music) (clock ticking) (spoons jingling) They say she's terribly sick. But she's so young and lovely. Young and lovely on the outside, maybe. Old and rotten on the inside, putrid and foul. - Oh, what a pity. - I wonder what ails her? - All her bones are decaying, and her organs are all rancid. And her blood is as malignant as slime. Would you just shut up! (dramatic music) Oh, well, here she is, up and around already. I've got to get out of here, Harry. This is unbearable, I just can take anymore. All right, fine. Now, just calm down. I want you to tell me something. How long have you been Dr. Jacobs' patient? - Three years, maybe four. - Mm-hmm. And when did she last give you a check-up? Two years ago. You know what the results were like? She said I was in great shape, except that I had low blood pressure. - Nothing else. - No. Are you sure? You're not holding anything back on us, now, are you? Of course not. Okay, I'll tell you what, we'll go take a look at Dr. Jacobs' files. (ominous music) Just be cool. Now, this is highly irregular. - What are we doing? - Shh. Gonna check on something. (door opening) - Well, what about that? - What? What is it? Don't you worry, baby. We'll have you out here in an hour. (sighs) Oh, thank God. You just go back to your ward and sit tight. Well, why are they keeping me here in the first place? Dr. Saxon acts as if I'm dying or something. Don't you worry about that. You let me handle it. Somebody's trying to play a con job on you, and I wonder who it is. You just go back to your room. (knocks softly) Dr. Saxon? (phone ringing) Hello? No, no, this is Harry. Yeah, okay, I'll be right up. What floor? Fine, be right there. (car horn honking) - Hello. - Yes, can I help you? Yes, I'm looking for Susan Jeremy. Is she a patient? She just came in to pick up some test results. I see. Let me try. Yes. Do we have a new admission of Susan Jeremy? I see. Thank you. Try the eighth floor nurse's station. I think they'll be able to help you there. (eerie music) Oh, who are you looking for? Miss Susan Jeremy. I've been waiting for two hours. Well, I don't know whether she can receive visitors or not. What? How come? Oh, Kitty? Now, he wants to see Miss Jeremy. Are you a relative? What the hell do you mean? Better check with Dr. Saxon. What's going on here? Well, you see, she's under observation. Observation? Well, what does that mean? It means she's under observation. Well, that explains everything. Where? Okay. Around this corner, 8-B. Make it fast. - Jack! Oh! - Hey. - Oh, God. - What is all this? - They won't let me go. - Why? What's going on? They said something's wrong. - Wrong? What do you mean? - I don't know. They've been treating me as if I've got leprosy or something, except they won't tell me anything. Well, how do you feel? - I feel perfectly fine. - Look, Sue, really? I'm all right, honest. Except, I'm really worried about Eva. Tom left her alone in his apartment. She's sitting there, waiting for us. Let's get outta here. - Can you? - I don't see who's gonna stop me. Okay. Get dressed, let's go. I don't even know where my clothes are. I'll just go just as I am. You have to sign out or something? Why bother? I never signed in. (tense music) - Going somewhere? - Yes, I'm checking out. Take Miss Jeremy back to her ward, please. - Yes, sir. - Yes, sir. I'm not going back to that zoo! - You'll have a private room. - I'm - Just as soon as one is available. I don't want a private room, I want out! Out! - Come on, Miss Jeremy. Get your hands off me. Harry said I could leave. Harry did? On whose authority? Take her back to her room. Come on, you gotta go. Now, calm down. Jack! For Christ's sake! Don't just stand there! Do something! - Come on. - Jack! Wait a minute! Is this necessary? - Necessary? - Yeah. - Yeah, I'm afraid so. - Why? She's very ill. Ill? Can't you tell me anything more? Please, we're engaged. There's a bench outside of my office. Why don't you go have a seat. I'll fill you in later. (ominous music) [Male Announcer] Will the gentleman waiting on the eighth floor please pick up the hall telephone? Will the gentleman waiting on the eighth floor please pick up the hall telephone? I'm the only gentleman in the hallway. Are you calling me? Of course I'm still here. I was told I could wait, so I waited. Yes. Yeah, what? Room 9117 No? Wait, I can't hear you. No, service to... right, right, I'll find him. (suspenseful music) (both scream) Jumping Christ! You scared the shit out of me! I'm sorry, I'm sorry. (grunts) I'm sorry. (ominous music) (Jack coughing) (eerie whispers chanting) (spoons jingling) (clacking) - Dr. Jacobs? Dr. Jacobs? - That's not Dr. Jacobs. Why, no, it's a fine young man. Well, where is Dr. Jacobs? (suspenseful music) (Jack coughing) (eerie whispers chattering) [Man] Over here. Come closer. Is she your mistress? I beg your pardon? [Man] Are you sleeping together? Does she let you hold her in your arms? Can you touch her wherever you like? In all her secret places? What is this, some sick joke or something? (suspenseful music) (saw buzzing) Please, help me! Please, don't! (screaming) (killer growling) (squelching) (clock ticking) (eerie music) (footsteps approaching) (Susan shrieking) Help me! Oh! Help me! Can somebody help me? (men groaning) (equipment rattling) (Susan screaming) (tense music) (Susan panting) (door clattering) (Susan gasping) (shrieking) It's all right! It's all right! It's all right. - Jack! It's Jack! - Jack left. - No, he didn't! No, he's here. (sobbing) Somebody cut off his head! Susan, you're being irrational! - No! No! - Stop it! No! - No! No! - Susan, stop. Cut it out! Come on, Kitty, get her outta here. Come on! Come on! - No! No! - Okay, show us where he is. - No! No! I don't wanna see him! - Come on, Susan. All right. Okay now, Susan, where is it? It's there in that box! Go on. (tense music) Go ahead, open it. So you have an unknown admirer, Susan. It was Jack's head! It was only a nightmare, Susan. The hell it was! And did they see it? They weren't here. Oh, they weren't here? It was Jack's head! No, it wasn't. No, it wasn't! I want you to stop this nonsense. Dr. Saxon, Harry got my medical chart from Dr. Jacobs' file. - He what? He said there was no reason to keep me in this goddamn hospital. He opened Dr. Jacobs' files? He said somebody's trying to con me. What'd he do with your chart? I don't know, he took it with him. All right. There are photostats of all of the doctors' files in the archives upstairs. I'll check on it in the morning. Why not right now? Go ahead, check it now! Here, Susan, take this. Thatta girl. Goodnight. - Goodnight. (suspenseful music) (phone ringing) (heavy breathing) (sinister whispering) (lighter clatters) (elevator bell dings) (Susan screams) Give me a cigarette, huh? What are you doing sneaking around this place? I bet you're waiting for your boyfriend, huh? I'm trying to escape out of here. Hey, what's your big rush? You know, stick around. We'll have a ball.

(all struggling) Get your hands off of me. Damn it, off! What are you doing? You stupid, stupid nurse! I'm trying to tell you I just saw a murder! - This is like the last time. - What are you doing to me? You have no right to do this! (screaming) - It's for your own good. - You stupid nurse! Listen to me! You stupid nurse! Somebody killed him, he's dead! Who do you think you are? This whole hospital is nuts! Don't you people understand somebody was just murdered? Let me out of this! Please, help! - Get her hip. Help me! Help! Don't you understand somebody was just murdered? What is wrong with this hospital? - Now what? - It's another seizure. I'm not having a seizure! She said she saw someone kill Dr. Saxon with an ax. He didn't try, he killed him! Some sort of hallucinatory fit, just like the last time. It looks like a typical attack of delirium tremens. Saxon was complaining of a lack of symptoms. This is clearly symptomatic enough. What is wrong with everybody in this hospital? (Susan groaning) (Beam groans) Why don't you listen to me? I'm trying to tell you somebody was Killed tonight. Keep her under observation. If anymore of this, I'm going to have to operate. I'm trying to tell you something!

His name is Kakyou Kuzuki, and in his dreams, he sees the future of our fragile planet. A great battle is approaching, a war of destiny to destroy the Earth, or to save it. Two sides, two points of view clash in apocalyptic strength, in a struggle that will tear the world apart and destroy the lives of many. Kakyou's love was the first casualty. Now, comatose and wishing only for death so he can join his beloved, he watches as the gears of fate begin to turn, and the soldiers of destiny march towards doom...", "transcript": "foodval.com - stop by if you're interested in the nutritional composition of food   ---  \n        I see a dream. I see the future inside my dreams. The two holy swords. It is also said that two \"Kamuis\" appeared. I'm Kakyou. An earth dragon, one of the seven angels. A seer, who sees the future in dreams. Where am I from? Why am I able to see the future? And what meaning does this have? Everything means nothing to me now. \n \n \n \n    (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n \n Everything has already been lost. At that time.. With the person I loved so much. Right there.. Please let me do this. Hokuto.. You shouldn't have come here.. If you come here.. You will be.. .. Dead! You cannot.. Don't come here.. What I saw in my dream.. Will come true. \n \n \n \n    (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n \n Hokuto.. Run.. Kakyou.. Why.. Why? Hokuto.. Madam.. It's over. He is dead? I believe it's just a matter of time. I understand. Do what you can for him. Yes. That boy.. He was born with the power to see the future in his dreams. This was his painful fate. Everything is over. Ended. Huh? Where am I? This is not my dream.. This means.. That this is your dream? Correct. This is my dream. Why was I able to enter your dream? Why? Because I wanted to see someone. Because I was alone all this time. I would like to see.. Someone. See someone? So would anyone be fine? You can't be saying that.. With a beautiful girl like me in front of you! Who are you? A prophet, perhaps? That's what I thought. I heard.. That there are people who can see the future in their dreams. Are you surprised that I know? I grew up in a family of paranormals. Ever heard of the Sumeragi clan? My little brother is the leader now. I don't know how to use most spells. Talentless, I think. But, having little power, I got to know him this way. My name is Hokuto Sumeragi. What is yours? Kakyou. Kakyou Kuzuki. Kakyou, huh? So why are you alone all the time? Didn't you leave there too? Is that why you wanted it yourself? It's not? So it's easy! I will take you somewhere. Where would you like to go? To anywhere. This is not worth it! Because it's our first date! I would like to see the sea. The sea? How about a sea like this? This is inside my dream. But the sea in real life is much more beautiful than this one! Since we know each other so well, I want to see you. Not in our dreams, but the real Kakyou. I want to see you too. But.. But? I cannot go out. Never. Nothing is absolute in this world. Everything is fine! You have Hokuto Sumeragi on your side! Good, let's go. Now let's go out! Even though I see the future where you die, I couldn't do anything. Not even to protect someone special to me. That was the moment my heart died. I won't do anything else. I can't feel anything. And.. Just sleep.. I will continue to see the future in my dreams. The dream of the tragedy that will happen in the future. I just watch it. The time of a new tragedy is approaching. Guided by destiny.. The dragons of the sky, the seven seals.. .. And the dragons of the earth, the seven angels, will gather. And the one who holds the key to the fate of the world.. Kamui. With the arrival of this boy, everything would start to move.. Towards a single future. The future is always.. one. No one can change this. All I can do is know the future through my dreams. I can't even save a soul, of so many that will be lost.. In the final battle. Everyone's fate has already been determined. Even if they find.. And hurt.. And love each other. I promised you.. That if anything happened to you, I would protect you. And this will not change either. Never. I had forgotten. You should forget about that too. And never do things you wouldn't do. This is our new promise. Kamui.. I choose you, girl. He chose? If I'm going to choose, I'd rather it be someone beautiful. Choose? What did you choose? The person for whom I will give my life! Am I interfering with your fun? No, I'm done. So tell me, Satsuki. That boy is the real \"Kamui\"? Beast replied yes. I understand. So it has finally started. I'm sure \"Kamui\" won't bother you. Do you smoke cigarettes? It's not good for your health. I've been looking for you all this time. Why? To make my wish a reality. You are one of the sky dragons, trying to save the earth from destruction. I have no interest in the future of the earth. Your wish.. is to kill me? I'm the one who killed your dear sister. You really are adorable, Subaru-kun. It's a good dog. A strange dog, but a good dog. And.. Hey.. Is.. something wrong, young lady? Did I do something bad? This is the first time I know someone who can see my Inuki. Answer me. Why can't we kill humans? Why are humans stronger than other creatures? It's not that! If a creature is stronger, is it okay to kill humans? It's not that. I will ask you one more time. Why can't we kill humans? Answer me. Inuki! It's a difficult question. Poor thing. That sky dragon.. I was going to cry because I didn't have an answer. An answer based on the ethical point of view. An idealistic answer. A biological response. There are many things that can serve as an answer. But none of them are a complete answer. What do you think, Yuto? Well, I think that's probably because.. People would be sad. Nataku, what is your wish? I don't know. But I don't think I'd like to part with you. Why? Because you look like.. my father. What did your father name you? Kazuki. There is no such thing as an emotionless creature. You just think you don't have them. I'm the one who should go. You have a wife and a lovely daughter. Kamui and the other seven seals are still young. But I.. Aoki-san! Do you think no one would cry for you if you died? I would cry. So there really were two \"Kamuis\". An accompanying star born to fill the empty place.. Whichever side, heaven or earth, the true Kamui will choose. Kamui chose to be a sky dragon, one of the seven seals. So the other \"Kamui\" is mine. It's not that.. The \"Kamui\" which is an earth dragon.. .. One of the seven angels, is already nearby. It's not that, Kanoe! Sister, I will prove to you that your premonition was correct. Kanoe! Don't invite \"Kamui\" inside! The earth calls for a revolution. A revolution that humans will not disturb. To do this, we will liquidate everyone who pollutes the earth. Mano.. The tragedy had repeated itself in dreams. This is destiny. Everyone just goes with the flow. There is only one future. One. Is that what you wanted? Yes. Because you had the potential to become a prophet, I could cross into your dreams. We have dreams even at the moment of our deaths. I knew this would happen. But, Even though I know the future, I can't do anything about it. The person who was so dear to me.. Is you.. I couldn't save any of you. Thank you, Kakyou. I have to go now. Kakyou.. If you see my brother and Kamui-chan, please tell them.. That I love them both. And.. That the future has not yet been decided. That the future has not yet been decided.. No. It has already been determined.. The moment I became an earth dragon. You should know that, if you're a prophet. There is only one future. Kakyou. Come with me. And weave dreams for me. For now, I still see the future in my dreams, Even though I know I can't do anything about it. Even so, I still hope.. That the words that girl said to me are true. And also.. That I may once again regain the courage.. That the person I loved so much gave to me. Nothing is absolute in this world. Everything is fine! You have Hokuto Sumeragi on your side! Good, let's go.

Thank you for joining us, let's get started. \n \n \n \n    (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n \n Welcome to the Alien Contact and Abduction Support Group. This is a group where we offer a non-judgemental place for people that have experienced the phenomenon of alien contact and abduction. We offer guidance and emotional support and I know through years of research that people are often left with more questions than answers and often this leads one to a state of confusion. But here, we hope that we can shed some light on your experience. Maybe all of us can help you find some peace and understanding for your particular experience. I understand what you're going through. It took me six months to come to a meeting. \n \n \n \n    (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n \n How did you find out about us? No one believes what happened to me out there in the desert. I was out there because I was meeting friends in Vegas and thought I'd stop by the Trona Pinnacles and take some photos. I told my friends and family but after awhile after I kept telling them about my experience and how I felt that they were talking to me, they just stopped coming around. I still have nightmares. I started to think that I was crazy and that I just dreamt it all up. But I know, I know that this is true. Something happened to me out there in the desert and I keep getting these headaches when I think about it too much. I finally did some research on alien abductions and I found this group. Yeah, that's because they're watching us. I know because they talk to me. That's why I wear this. Right John? Yes, I believe there is a phenomenon that I experienced when I was in the military and I've felt the same way as all of us. But I wear this because I don't want to be found... by anyone. Me either but I don't wanna have to wear something like that. Mm mm, I lost all my friends and family. It's 'cause they were taken by them. They're not gonna get me again, no way, uh-uh. What made you decide to come here? I was having these nightmares all the time. I just wanted them to stop. I still don't know what happened to my husband. My nightmares haven't stopped neither, and I've been coming here almost six months. Yeah, yeah we know. We all have to hear you talk about it for the last six months. - Screw you, Melanie. - Hey calm down everyone. One at a time. We're not here to judge each other's experiences. We're here to welcome Eric. I want to thank you again for sharing. Since this is Eric's first time here, I thought we'd all go around the room and tell him why we're all here. Why don't we start with you, Becky? Okay. I had a husband. We were really in love. Then we went camping one night in the woods. What are you doing? I want to document our trip, babe. Could you not? Why not? Because I don't feel like being filmed right now, okay? You wanna stop, please? Okay guys, go night night. The dogs sleepin' okay? Yeah, I think they really like it here. What is that? I don't know. I mean it's too far in the woods to be car headlights. It's probably just another camper with a lantern. I've never seen a lantern like that before, it's weird. You know what, it's probably just the Park Ranger comin' around and makin' sure everybody's camping permits are up to date. Yeah... maybe. Jimmy, Daisy, quiet. Quiet, knock it off. Something's got 'em spooked. Listen. It's a weird noise, it's no animal, it's not crickets. I don't know what it is, you don't hear it? But I definitely don't have a good feeling about this. There it is again. What is that? I have no idea what that is. It's really creepin' me out babe, go get the gun. Okay, let's go take a look. Okay, you go first. Harry. Snap out of it. Harry! Leave him alone! Harry? Harry! Leave him alone. What happened? Harry? Harry, what is that thing? What happened in the woods? Calm down, Becky. This is a gift. This will solve all the problems. What are you talking about? I must bring this into the world. It is a gift for everyone. How do you know that? They told me. Who's \"they,\" Harry? You'll see. Jimmy, Daisy, no, leave it. No, oh my god, no! Jimmy? Daisy? Jimmy? Daisy? Come on, guys. Daisy? Jimmy? Daisy? Jimmy? Come on, guys. Daisy? Jimmy? Don't scream. Who are you, what are you doing out here? I know what's happening right now, I saw what happened. - What are you talking about? - The crystal, your husband. - The visions. - How do you know about that? We can't let it happen, it's got to be stopped. Stop what? We can't let him take the crystal into the city full of people. Think of what will happen. They don't want to save the planet, they want to sterilize the entire planet. I have seen the visions. What are we supposed to do, get rid of the crystal? The crystal can't be destroyed. All we can do is hide it for now. But they always seem to find it and find another way. How do you know that? The same thing happened to my wife and many others. I've seen it happen several times. What are we supposed to do? We've got to get the crystal from him. We gotta get it back. How? Every time I grab it, I get burned. We have to do something or else this is what will happen. How did they die? All of them victims, my wife is buried there too. She went mad when she found the crystal, she killed herself. I buried her here to hide her and the crystal, hoping no one would ever have to suffer the same fate. Your husband can't take the crystal into the city, he just can't. We better hurry because he can't get very far. I've got the keys. You need to go in and distract him. I'll see if we can take the crystal from him. Okay, I'll talk to him. Harry? What are you looking for, babe? The keys, okay? I need the car keys, we gotta get outta here. I don't know, why? We gotta go back to town, all right? I'll explain later but where are the damn keys? - Babe, what's going on? - Stop yelling at me please. It hurts, where's the keys? - Baby please. - Oh my god. We gotta get outta here, please! I didn't mean for you to hurt him. Don't be fooled, he's not your husband anymore. He's not trying to get to a hospital, he's trying to get to the city. Wait, don't do it. You remember the last time you did that? I have to try. Stop! Harry, stop! Stop, Harry stop! Please stop. Stop. Please... let me go home. Please. Don't you have any compassion? Let me go. Let us go. Where's my husband? He's gone already, I tried my best to stop him. What can I do? - Nobody's gonna believe me. - You have to keep going. All right, come on. Oh, my arms are broken. If you wanna have a chance, just leave me. Harry, wait! Hey lady. Help me. So how did you get so far out here? My husband's hurt, I'm trying to find him. Look, I don't know what you're talking about with all that but let me get you to the hospital, okay? Wait stop stop stop, that's him. Let me out, let me out. Are you sure you wanna do this? Isn't that the guy who hurt you? Harry. Harry, wait. May I get a ride into the city? Hop in. To this day, I know they implanted something in my tooth. I can hear them every day. Do you hear them right now? No. They talk to me when I'm alone or when I'm with a non-believer. They wanna make you look crazy. They implanted something in my head too except I hear these high pitched sounds and somehow I can understand them but they only communicate with me when I'm sleeping, in my dreams. Thank you for your honesty and most importantly, your courage. Pardon me, everyone. I'm sorry to bother you. Is this the alien abduction group? - How can I help you? - My daughter, she's missing. I found out about you and I need your help. If she's missing, why don't you just go to the police, ma'am? No, you don't understand, I think she was abducted. I think you should let her in, I think she's telling the truth. I don't think this is a good idea. - They could've followed her. - I think Matt's right. How do we know she's not one of them? Because look at her, she's terrified. I do not like this idea, she could be one of them. I really think she needs to go, they could've followed her. Matt, that's enough. - Come on in. - Thank you. I know you don't know who I am but I'm telling the truth. My daughter was babysitting while she was away at college. - Where is she now? - I don't know. The last I heard from her, she left me this message. Mom, I hope you get this. Hi mom, I'm at my babysitting job. I'm going to be studying tonight because I have my Astrology exam next week. You're gonna be really happy to hear this. Once I finish, I'm finally going to be able to graduate and get my Doctorate so that I can write my dissertation. I know you don't want me going to Puerto Rico but they have the largest telescope there. I know you're thinking, what is she talking about? Oh by the way, there's going to be a lunar eclipse tonight. So I hope you get a chance to go outside and see it. Well I'm putting my phone on vibrate because I don't want to wake the baby, so I'll talk to you later, bye. Pleasant dreams, little one. Hi. No, you cannot. Brian, this is important to me. Besides, they don't even know you and they would not appreciate me having guests over. I'll call you tomorrow morning. Let's get together for lunch for sure, okay? Hello? Brian? Weird. Where would the fuse box be? Kitty? Kitty? Okay. They're coming to get you, Barbara. Stop it, you're ignorant. Oh, no. I said you will call no one. Hello? You will listen to my orders, you will listen and obey. Hello, who's there? Whoa. Dammit, it's still not working. Oh no. What happened? Hello, Mrs. Murphy. Yes, went to bed about 30 minutes ago. Are you having a good time at the party? Well yeah, everything's good here except... the electricity went out, the TV's been acting funny. Also the landline, it's not working. Well, don't worry, I'm sure everything will be fine by the time you're back. My phone is fully charged. I'll see you guys in a couple of hours. Bye. Hello? Is anybody there? What is that? Hello? Can I help you? Actually I came over to check on you. Our electricity went out and has not come back on yet. Our electricity went out here too but I managed to get it back on. Maybe the electric company hasn't fixed ours yet. Well can I help you with anything else, candles, flashlights? - No, we're good for now. - Well thanks for stopping by. One more thing. I think something got the cat here on the porch. That's terrible. Probably a wild dog or something. Something funny's definitely going on. Well lock your doors, goodnight. Goodnight. Hello, hello? Hello? Damn it. Hello? No. No. No. No. Help! I'm coming. No! Not the baby! Well that was fun. I gotta get up in five hours. Look out! No! No! No! No! Mom, I hope you get this. You have to believe there's something here killing us. I hear it coming. Can you hear it? From the sky. I haven't heard from her since. I went to the house but nothing, there's no trace of her. What about the kid's parents? Missing. How are you so certain it's an alien abduction and why would you come to us for help? When I went to look for her, I found her phone. And when I looked at it, it contained video of what happened. At least what I could see. Do you have it, the proof? - Yes I do. - I don't believe you. I knew it, I knew it, I've seen it, I knew I wasn't crazy. Wait, you're saying that that is what took you? That's not what took me. That's not what took me either. Are you calling me a liar? Why does everybody else have a different experience than you? I don't know, I just know what I saw. Guys, this isn't the place for judgements. What if all our experiences are different? What if there are other alien species? - What? - Yes. Other aliens here doing the same thing. Another species, that's a good point. What about it, John? Ah! Oh my god! Take this, put this over your back tooth. Hold this behind your neck. Are you okay? How did you know how to do that? - They must be implanted. - Implanted? You mean there's something inside of them? - Are they listening? - Perhaps. But we're blocking it now. Is that thing real on the video? Where did you find that phone? It was laying next to the baby crib when I went inside to look for my daughter. What if it was left there? You think they did it on purpose? Why else would they lead her here? I think they might be trying to give us some information. You said you found that phone by the baby's crib, right? I don't know, there was no sign of a baby. Just a smell, I've never smelt it before. What kind of smell? I mean what did it remind you of? Maybe like meat, not quite fresh but not rotted yet either. I know that smell, like a fresh piece of steak right before you cook it. - Yeah, like that. - Yeah. That's the smell I sensed right before they took my family and my friends. This is Deacon, I'm at the remote location. No bodies, no one. It's happened again, the smell is unbearable, putrefaction. The species was dominant. Same thing, she's on the move. Here tilt your head back, put pressure on it okay? It'll take the swelling off your face. Aspirin? Do you want some aspirin? - Go on. - It's just aspirin. - It'll help with the pain. - Take it. Please don't let my husband anywhere near me. Do you have pain anywhere else? I knew it, that's where he was kicking her. Is it hard for you to breathe? - No. - Good. What's your name? It's Kara, he's usually a good man. It's just that he has a really short temper. It's okay Kara, it's okay, you're safe now all right? My name is Adrian, do you remember how you got here? I've just never seen him like that before. All right. You can stay here as long as you want, you're safe okay? Hello? Hello? Hello? Why do you keep trying to use your cell phones? You know we don't have reception up here. I always try my cell phone. Why when you know it doesn't work? I don't know. This is why you should have landlines for emergencies like this, not cool. I've had one before and people abused it. We are out in the middle of nowhere. Who is gonna help us, what do we do with her? Where are we gonna take her? Outside, upstairs, what are we gonna do? Not yet, no. Let me get her water. Here, give that to her. Sip that, it'll help. I promise it'll help you. Listen to my voice, you need to drink something. Do you have any other areas of pain, are you feeling dizzy? I have never seen him like that before. He's been so different lately. I'm gonna go check on him. They usually get like that before they're about to get caught doing something stupid. How often does he do this? There's something very different about him lately. That's usually the first sign of an affair. It's okay, it's okay, it's just water, it's just water. What is that, will you go check on them please? Make sure they have the situation under control. Come on, come on, come on, come on. No, don't you go passing out on me. Not yet. You still think you're a big mother, don't you? - Don't you? - I didn't-- I did not! You did not what, homes? - Beat the piss outta your wife? - No, I didn't! Liar! Stop. Stop. Uncle Tony, please just do what they say. Please, if you stop now, I won't press charges. Why do you still come in my room and watch me sleep? What? What? Bitch, you're crazy, my hands have been tied since you crazy broads brought me here. No. Yeah. - What are you doing? - How 'bout this? - What are you doing? - Did you say \"press charges\"? Well the Sheriff's gonna be here in just a few hours and we're gonna press charges on your ass. Cindy, don't do this. He obviously needs help, I mean maybe-- Don't talk to me like you know me or like we're friends. Maybe it'd be better if you went and sat outside. That's right sweets, new girls need to mind their neck, okay? - It's such a crazy day. - You're crazy. You think I want this dude saved? - Don't move. - He raped me. My uncle raped me. What? I didn't rape you, I didn't touch you! Touch me again Uncle Tony, I swear to God I will slit your throat and I will not call the police. You don't know what you have in that kitchen. I'm about sick of this guy. Oh, Jesus! You tore that nose up like you were cuttin' paper. His old ass felt like paper. Oh no, you did not just headbutt me. That son of a bitch passed out on us again, Cindy. We'll see about that. What are you doing? What are you doing? What does it look like I'm doing? Look-- Jesus. I was knitting a blanket with that. I am not the enemy here. The enemy's in that room. You have no idea what she's gonna do. You people decided to attack me and not hear reason. You hit me with a rock before you could hear what was going on! We heard screaming and we followed the screams to a clearing to find you beating your wife. - She-- - You were choking her! You took your knee and stabbed it in her face. Which I doubt you would do that again. Please. Don't do this. You need me. Melanie, don't. What are you doing to him? This doesn't make it right. You all were doing so well. Please, they're trying to kill me. Shut up. I wasn't talking to you, I was talking to my girls. You're all mentally deranged. - I can't stomach your face. - You need to understand. Something's there in the next room waiting. My daddy was a monster and you know what he would do? He would put me in the corner of a room and he would beat me with anything he could find. So don't you dare tell me what a monster is. Cindy, will you go and make us some tea please? Would you like some tea? I was just thinking, as I was getting my ass kicked in, I could certainly go for some Royal English breakfast tea. You're so disrespectful. Melanie, enough. Go check on Kara, see if she's hungry. Is that her name, Kara? Cindy, the English breakfast tea will be just fine. Can you also bring me a first aid kit, please? I don't want-- what is your name again? - It's Edgar Price. - Edgar. I don't want Edgar bleeding all over my floors. Well Edgar, my name is Adrian, you do know where you are? I just need to finish what I set out to do. And what is that? I need to kill the last of 'em before the next phase. I'm sorry, I'm not following you. Look, you people are in grave danger as long as that thing is under this roof. Are you referring to your wife, Kara? - She's not a thing. - That's not my wife. You can't take out all your anger on women. Women are special. Men are too. I named this house when I opened it the Sullivan House after Anne Sullivan. You people are man-bashers that hide behind a cause? Don't you know what's about to go down here, Adrian? I will not be a victim no more. Lady, if we don't get outta here in about 45 minutes, we're all gonna be dead. That's how long a phase takes. Cindy was forced to get high with her father and then violently used as a punching bag. She's been in our program for 90 days. Well I'm thinking they all had a relapse. It's called anger. Sometimes you see something and it triggers a memory, no matter how much a person has changed. So yeah, I guess you could say we had a relapse, but when we see somebody beating their wife, nearly killing them, we lose our shit, then we strike. I guess you have a story as well. How do you take your tea, Edgar? Lady, enough with the games, tea time is over, untie me. I was seven when my mother died. That's when my father turned to alcohol. He used to lock me in closets every time I pissed him off. That's when I ended up in a shelter and I read The Miracle Worker, and that changed my life. It made me want to help. So I wanted to open up a place for battered women. You save lives, that's very noble of you. Well let me tell you what's about to go down here. Kara, she'll be coming out to conclude the last phase at the Sullivan House if you don't untie me now! What type of work do you do, Edgar? What? She asked what type of work do you do? - I work for the government. - Doing? - I work for the government-- - Is your job stressful? Yes. What exactly do you do for the government? I work for a group that monitors extraterrestrial life here on earth. What? Like E.T.? Lady, you wish they all look like E.T. They are ruthless, they walk amongst us imitating what we do. All they need is some sort of DNA from that person and then they multiply and feast. When that happens, they call us. We are highly trained to seek out and destroy, period! No matter what or who they transform into, you cannot look at them as human, period! She's an alien, your wife's an alien? She ate my wife. What they eat, they become. That's when they can be put down. During their transformational stage, they're vulnerable. Their personal protection field is shut down. They are here to, where's that other girl Melanie, where'd she go? - Oh chill out-- - Checking on E.T. She's been with her too long, call her. She's probably trying to phone home. Call her. Chill out, enough with this. Melanie? - Melanie? - Untie me now! Mel. She's done. Yes? - Everything okay? - Yes. Douchebag here thought you were kidnapped by aliens. She is not okay. You were watching her ass, right? - What? - I saw you. Melanie is done, you people need to untie me now. Did you like watching her? You just saw her, she's fine. She is not fine! Cindy, go check on Mel. Jill, stop harassing our new guest. Guest? You meant hostage. Did his spooky alien story get to you? No, but he believes it enough to piss his own pants. Jill, let me know if he watches my ass too on the way out. Mel. Give me the scissors. Why? Don't, he might do something to us. No, I'm here to help you. Edgar, tell me again what is it that you actually do? You know what I do and now I have failed. Please, cut me loose now. Mel? I'll go check on them. Please, cut me loose, please. - Cindy? - Cut me loose. Melanie? Cut me loose, please, please, please. - Shut up! - Cut me loose. Shut up. - Adrian. - Melanie? Adrian. Adrian , cut me loose. For the love of God, please. I'm sorry. Then you see, there are multiple species. It's all true, we're not alone, they live among us. They breed with us, they eat us. Literally thousands of people go missing every year with no explanation and no one goes looking for them. I believe you now but what can we do? What are we supposed to do? No one believes us, I mean we have no proof. But don't you have proof, though? I mean the chip inside your tooth, haven't they taken x-rays of it? I can hear them, I can feel them. I have a scar to prove it, you saw what happened. Advanced technology. - Well maybe. - No yeah, yeah. I mean we know electricity exists, right? But we can't see it. How do I explain that I can hear them in my mind? - I can't. - Wait, wait. None of this was happening until you two showed up today and then she came and showed us that video. I mean you two are new here, how do we explain, is this supposed to be a coincidence? That is a discussion for another day, Matt. No, we need to discuss it now. - How do you explain it? - I'm not sure. It all means something, I just think that maybe we need to, we need to team together. Why are you being so defensive? I'm not being defensive, Matt. I just think that now that this group is becoming more known and we're getting more people to join us and maybe these visions that we all think we see, they're just made up. These are not made up stories, John. These are not just dreams, okay? I have the scars to prove it. Somebody here is not being honest. - Somebody's lying. - This is not helping at all. Everybody calm down, just calm down. Take a five minute breather, okay? Everybody just, just take five. Is this what you saw? Where did you find that? Is this what you were looking for? Where did you find that? Harry should have finished his mission. What's going on here? You should've let him finish his mission. Now we will have to find someone else who will. They're here. I can hear them talking. I don't know what's going on. No, I feel terrible. They're here now. Oh my god, Matt. We need to get outta here.

{"title": "X: The Man with the X-Ray Eyes (1963) - full transcript", "plot": "Dr. James Xavier is a world renowned scientist experimenting with human eyesight. He devises a drug, that when applied to the eyes, enables the user to see beyond the normal realm of our sight (ultraviolet rays etc.) it also gives the user the power to see through objects. Xavier tests this drug on himself, when his funding is cut off. As he continues to test the drug on himself, Xavier begins to see, not only through walls and clothes, but through the very fabric of reality!", "transcript": "foodval.com - stop by if you're interested in the nutritional composition of food   ---  \n        Now, look right. Left. They're both fine. Retina's clear, muscles are perfect. How is my vision, Doctor? Excellent, Doctor, as we previously tested. Let's sit over here. Why are you really here, James? As I told you, to get my eyes examined. Let's have another look. You had the same examination three months ago. \n \n \n \n    (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n \n What makes you think your eyes have changed in three months? Nothing. Nothing yet. Then this has something to do with your research. You're planning to experiment upon yourself, aren't you? All right. You're a fine doctor. You know what you're doing. But you only have one pair of eyes. And with them I want to see. You see fine. Sam, what's the range of human vision? - Distance? - No, wavelength. Between 4,000 angstrom units and 7,800 angstrom units. You know that. Less than one-tenth of the actual wave spectrum. \n \n \n \n    (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n \n What could we really see if we had access to the other 90%? Sam, we are virtually blind. All of us. You tell me that my eyes are perfect. Well, they're not. I'm blind to all but a tenth of the universe. My dear friend, only the gods see everything. My dear doctor, I'm closing in on the gods. Go ahead, Doctor, make a diagnosis. Foreign object. Bullet, it looks like, in the chest cavity. All right. How about this one? Lesion in the heart area, maybe in the lungs. Might be carcinoma. Or a clot. Or just a fog on the plate. Could be any number of things. But what is it, really? Just a shadow play. A pattern to be used for intelligent guesswork. A slight help towards saving the life of the man who made those shadows. Immense help, Dr. Xavier. When you have nothing better, anything is an immense help. That's light. Waves of energy that excite the eye. And the nerve cells transmit this energy to the brain. And with the brain, we see. But there are other forms of energy with different wavelengths. Dr. Xavier, I've read your report. Yes, but do you understand it? Have you any idea what I'm trying to accomplish here? Dr. Fairfax, I'm developing a way to sensitize the human eye so that it sees radiation, up to and including the gamma rays and the meson wind. Yes, I understand. I understood your objective when I first read your report. Then why are you here? Because the report in question was dated nine months ago. Because since that time, you have drawn over $27,000 of the foundation's money and we haven't had a word from you. - Well, there have been problems. - Then report them. To whom, a group of businessmen who can't tell one quantum jump from another? No, to me. The foundation found your research worthy of support. They also appointed me as liaison to these special projects. Listen, Doctor, I've given up my own research to help the foundation and I won't be talked to as if I were a child in kindergarten. I knew of your reputation, but I hadn't heard about your temper. - Now, Doctor... - You want a progress report? I'll give you something better. A demonstration. Come with me. Doctor Morgan... You can be of some help. Put these on. Now, these are hormones, enzymes. Their megalostructures have been slightly altered. Prepare that one in number two, the second cage down. He won't bite you. It's all right. Now, this compound, when used in the eye, increases receptivity. The sensitivity is enormously increased. - Well, you've tried it? - No. Well, you're blunt, Doctor. The monkey's been conditioned, standard pleasure-pain technique. Come on. Come on. All right, bring him here. Put him there. Now, when he sees the white, he'll pull the corresponding switch and the light will go on. When he sees the blue, he'll do the same thing and the blue light will go on. And the same thing with the red. Now, watch. Nothing up the sleeves. White, the one he normally sees. But he can't see the blue. It's covered by the white screen. But he does see it. And the red. He sees the red. Well, they're both covered. But don't you understand yet? He sees through them, as if they were glass. What did he see? What did he see? Thanks, Doctor. Can't find a thing. The tissues are fine. The autopsy? Heart failure, nothing else. I'd call it shock. Because of what it saw? No, because it couldn't comprehend or adjust to what it saw or saw through. That's all. No pathology, no degeneration, tissues perfectly healthy. Dr. Fairfax... I think after tonight's work, you can call me Diane. Thank you. I'd like to buy you a cup of coffee. That's the best experiment I've heard all night. You're on, Doctor. Do you take it black? - Yes. - Good. Now, you're a pretty good worker. Why did you give up research and take to moneylending? I don't lend it, I give it away. A million dollars before breakfast every morning. How do your eggs taste then? Flat. You didn't answer my question. I did, in a way. When the foundation picked me for the job, I didn't want it, and then I did. Why? Because it needed somebody who cared, somebody who would support some of the... Well, more untraveled paths. Like mine? James, why do you want to see so much? Well, why do you want to go on breathing? To stay alive. It's much the same thing with me. I'm curious, intensely curious. No, I mean the purpose. How can you use your new vision? There are thousands of ways. You're sitting right on top of probably the most important one right here. In this hospital, there are people I can help. Help by seeing inside them, as if they were windows. By seeing their sicknesses with a clarity that would make X-rays a tool fit only for witchdoctors. Your foundation doesn't like my work, does it? They want you to appear before them the day after tomorrow. I'll be there, and I'll bring them much more than a report. No, it's too dangerous. Then who is going to try it? Some student? Some intern? Yes. Or better yet, some convicted murderer. Anyone who has less to lose than you. And how are they going to report it? \"My eyes feel funny\"? \"Gee, Doc, I've got a headache\"? That monkey died. It was a monkey, not a man. - I tell you, no. - Yes. I won't be a party to it. All right. I'll proceed without you. Sam. Sam, I need you. All right. When do you want to do it? Now. August 14th, notes on experiment designated \"X.\" Experimental subject myself, James Xavier. Assisting in experiment, Dr. Samuel Brant. You ready, Doctor? Ready, Doctor. The compound fully described in a written report has been prepared. Dr. Brant will administer one drop into each eye of the subject. One drop. Any choice? Yeah. One in the middle. Tilt your head and look directly up. Well, here it goes, James. Good luck. How long? Eight to 10 seconds. All right, open your eyes. James? It's like a splitting of the world. Vision is fragmented. More light than I've ever seen. Filled with light. I have to close them. Are you all right? I'm fine. I'm gonna try again. Everything is normal. Wait. Sam, I can see through it. Right through it. \"The exact combination of hormones and enzymes \"is to be determined by analysis.\" Good Lord, Jim. You can! Sam, your lab coat. My coat? There's a pen in your shirt pocket. And there's a button missing under your tie. Sam, it works. It works! I still have just penetrated the surface. My eyes are not quite conditioned yet. But it's a start. Sam, another drop in each eye. Not now. There should be tests. There might be side effects. All right, I'll do it myself. The light! The light! Well, that's the tape, gentlemen. And, of course, the reason Dr. Xavier can't be present today. I've asked Dr. Brant to represent him here. Dr. Xavier has been unconscious since yesterday, when this experiment took place. I've been asked by Dr. Fairfax to speak on his behalf about the continuation of his research funds. Now, you read the reports, you heard the tape of Dr. Xavier's first experiment. I think, gentlemen, you will agree that a fantastic breakthrough is possible. Unbelievable might be a better choice. Dr. Xavier is unable to speak for himself, but his work speaks for him. It can and will be repeated by others besides himself. It is up to this foundation to finance the further work that is necessary. I must confess to you, Doctor, that I don't believe in the continuance of this work. I mean... Well, there still is nothing positive that has come out of it. But, Mr. Bowhead... I'm very sorry, Dr. Fairfax, but I believe our foundation can no longer channel its funds into this work. And that's all. They voted against you. I tried. Dr. Brant. - Sam and I, we've tried. - Everything. They decided to withhold the funds. So, they cut me off like an arm with gangrene. - Maybe they're right. - No, they're wrong. And I'll show them just how wrong. We better leave now. He needs rest. James, I'll order the bandages removed tomorrow. Bandages? Yes. I hardly noticed them. Hardly noticed them at all. - You'll get your chance again, James. - Yes, I will. I think it's for the best, in any case. You need a rest from research. A return to doctoring will be just the right prescription. - Maybe the hospital could... - No, we've been through it before. We need all our funds just to keep this place going. Well, that's it. I want you in surgery tomorrow. You'll assist me. Why, thank you, Dr. Benson, thank you. It's nice to have you back with us. You might look in on a patient named Stanton in Ward three. I've left the reports and the diagnosis on your desk. Right. May I help you, Doctor? Yes, a patient named Stanton? Yes, right over here. - Thank you. That'll be all, nurse. - Yes, Doctor. He's wrong. The diagnosis is wrong. Doctor? Your eyes. Go back to sleep, dear. Pretty, isn't she? Yes, very. Doctor, I want you to reconsider this operation. Why? You say she has a stenosis. You're wrong. It's a tumor directly in the auricle attached to the valve. Nonsense. The X-rays were taken from every angle. Dr. Benson, I know what I'm saying. You'll be cutting into the wrong area of the heart. Doctor, I shall expect you in surgery at 6:00. I will perform the operation exactly as I outlined it. Thank you, Doctor. Yes, right away. Doctor, someone... Are you all right? Yes, just a temporary headache. - May I get you something? - No. No, thank you. - There's someone waiting for you, Doctor. - All right. I was waiting for you. James, what's wrong? It's nothing. It's just a readjustment. Your eyes. - You're continuing to use the... - Yes, I am. The vision comes and goes. But tonight I saw very clearly, very deeply. And what the devil are you doing here so late? A surprise for you. Bo, not another one. My life's too full of them. Come along. Where are you dragging me? I have young friends who have a cure. For what disease? Intense doctors. Dr. Holmes... About 10 ccs, Doctor. - Exactly. - Beautiful. Beautiful. Be my guest. Here you are, perfect martinis. - Thank you. - Thank you. Ethyl or gin? Well, in deference to your high standings, Doctors, gin. I think I got formaldehyde. - It's been nice talking to you. - It's all right, I love it. Well, are you enjoying yourself? Well, who couldn't around you? My, you're almost romantic. Well, it's just a passing symptom. I don't think I want you cured after all. My dance, Doctor. As one of your ex-students, I have rights. - That'll be all right. - Excuse us. Hi. Hi, I said. Hi. I saw you clear across from over there. Gee, you've got sharp eyes. When I use them. I want you to dance with me. I like the way you look, kind of urgent. I like men who look urgent. - I'll remember that. - Come on. Headache? Headache? No, it's just my eyes. You like the way I dance? It's fine. It's just fine. Jim? My turn, now. - Did you find that fun? - Yes. Yes. - You know, you're quite lovely. - Thank you. Matter of fact, you're very attractive. Well, one drink certainly makes you a different man. Well, you could say I'm really seeing you for the first time. And that's the most interesting birthmark you have above the third rib on your left side. But how do you know that? Why, you can see me. And your backbone's a sheer delight. But remember, I am a doctor. Well, you remember that I'm a woman. I can hardly forget it. Come on, I'm getting you out of here. Good morning, Doctor. Good morning, nurse. Good morning, James. Good morning, Doctor. Are you all right? Yes. Perfectly all right. Why do you want me here? I don't know. I think I'm afraid. Diane, what do you know? Only that he's been using the drug again. Ready. Doctor, you must reconsider the procedure. Scalpel. Let go of my hand. Doctor, I shall perform this operation. James, have you gone out of your mind? No, but I want this girl to live. Second blade. I'm going to continue. It seems, Doctor, you are now unable to continue. James, you've gone mad. No. I know exactly what I'm doing. More exactly than any other doctor's ever known before. You think I'm mad? Well, watch. All of you, just watch. You know of my experiments. Dr. Benson knows. What I'm doing is a direct result of those experiments. I can see the heart and the lungs and the internal structures quite clearly. Doctor, we could stop him. No. Swab. All right. You see, Dr. Benson, no stenosis. - Take the patient into recovery. - Yes, Doctor. Dr. Xavier, are you finished? Yes. I'm sorry, there was nothing else I could do, but the girl will live. Dr. Ryan, will you write the postoperative orders? You know what you did was unethical. I had no choice. You realize that news of it has probably spread through the hospital, perhaps even reached the papers. You saw what I've accomplished. I don't know what I saw. But this I do know. You will be tried for malpractice. - Jim. - Diane. - You've got to get away from here. - You're coming with us. Yes, I'm very tired. L, T, N, U, E, X. James. James. Yes, it persists. The effect is cumulative. I see veins, organs, the blood rushing through your heart. I look at Diane, and she appears a perfect, breathing dissection. But, Jim, there must be some way to control it. Of course. Ask your foundation for the money to discover it. We don't need the foundation, any of them. - We'll work together. We'll find a reversal. - No. That's just what I don't want. I'm going on. You can't. I won't permit it. The drug works upon the eyes. - They're the direct route into the brain. - I don't care. What is happening is beyond my hopes. A cumulative effect. Soon, I'll be able to see what no man has ever seen. And, Sam, I want you with me. With new eyes, we'll explore all the mysteries of creation. With knowledge there is power. The power to learn, to create, to do. I proved it today. Jim, who knows what other parts of your mind are affected by this thing. Sam. Jim, it's the only way. Someone has to care for you. Now, push up your sleeve. No! You killed him. - Yes. - Jim. - He was my friend. - You've got to get away. But you saw what happened. They won't believe me, not after the operation. They'll think you're insane. Insane? Insane? Diane, do you... The police. Jim, you've got no time. They'll blame you no matter what we say. One of the most fantastic performances ever to appear here in the carnival show. And you'll enjoy the fabulous things he can do with his fantastic eyes and mind. Hey, you boys over there. You two fellows, step right over here, you're embarrassing the girls. Come on over here and see a show. We're gonna present to you one of the finest shows on earth. Big deal. Hey, buddy, how would you like it if I step on your hands? Nobody likes a wise guy. This man, ladies and gentlemen, he can read your mind. Tell you what you're thinking. Can he tell me where my wife is? Yeah, buddy, on a broom flying around the pier. That's where your wife is. I need guys like you. Come on, you people, he's ready to begin. The man they call Mentallo. The Mentallo, the man with the miraculous mind. Step right up, folks. You're in for one of the greatest, exciting evenings of your life. Good crowd. Yes, I know. All right, everybody. All right, gang. Here he is, Mentallo. Write your thoughts down here and he will read them to you just by pressing them against his forehead. Anything you wanted to write, anything at all. How about my mother-in-law's will? I hope she leaves a picture of your wife, smart guy. Ask him where you get those clothes. The same Army & Navy store you bought yours. Okay? Here's a pencil. Come on, gang. He's a fake. I know how they do this. The first paper he gets is a phony. When he opens the second one to check on it, he's really reading the first. He's one ahead the whole time. Smart. Smart? I heard that, too. Everybody, let's feed the monkeys, so we can go on with the show. All right, pal? You got a thought, or do you wanna sit there and play with your blocks? I could play with your blocks. Here, give him this. Real smart kid. I love those kind of guys. We meet them every time here, but doesn't phase Mentallo. He'll answer every one of them. Here we go. Here you are. This is from a lady who wants to know if I wear this outfit to pin tails on donkeys. See? That's the ringer. That's the ringer, smart guy? What are you, Dick Tracy? How about that, folks? That's exactly what the young lady said. That's right. If the lady will step forward, I will demonstrate. This is from a man who wants to know how much money he has in his pocket. - There it is. - I spent it all to get in here. If the gentleman will stand up, I will tell him. Judging from your appearance, I would say a quarter. This is from a young man who says I am a fake. Would you like a further demonstration of my powers? - It's a trick. - Is it? Your name is John Trask. You've come from Phoenix. You're 27 years of age, you're unmarried. Your social security number is 6-0-9-1-0-6-6-1-4. You have a watch on your person, a gift from your father. How do you know that? You also have a letter in your pocket from a girl you deserted. A girl who loves you. Shut up. This is your trick, ain't it? I have no trick. You gotta. Everybody does. It's in the mask. Can you see through it? No. There's a switch or something. No switch. Then, how? Look, you can trust me. You've been on the pier a month now, and nobody's caught on. You've got something great here. Great. Thank you. In fact, it's so great, I sometimes wonder what you're doing here on the small-time hustle. What do you mean? I didn't mean nothing. Except, I wonder, what do you want, Mr. Mentallo? Please leave. I didn't mean nothing. Come on, get out. September 19th, the fluid is almost gone. I use only the smallest amounts now, but the effect seems to be cumulative. But how can I work without a laboratory, without equipment, without money to buy what I need? There's so much undone, so much I don't understand. He drove them off today like they were scared. I saw them run from his show. Said he saw too much. He's all right, does his job. He keeps to himself. Why not? He's got a right. Does he? We all live and work together. He gives me the creeps. Maybe we give him the creeps. Did you ever see his eyes? He always wears those glasses and that mask. Now, Crane hustles for him. Crane, he thinks he's real. Real? What do you think, he's a ghost? Well, what he does is real. No tricks. - Coffee? - Sure, you bet. Two coffees. He sees not through your mind, but through things like paper and cloth. - He's got a good act, that's all. - No. Yeah, an act. What else could it be? A man that could really see through things, he wouldn't be here. No, he wouldn't. He'd be something big, powerful. He'd be something special. What would he be? He'd know secrets. Secrets he could use. A hold on people, that's what he would have. Something to make them listen to him. That what you think? I never think. I eat. Maybe he could help keep people from hurting each other. How? By telling everybody everything. No secrets, what's anybody got to fight about? Same things they've always fought about. Ideas, thoughts, differences. I'd stop them. If I had your power, I'd stop them. I'd make them do things my way or I'd hurt them all, if I had your trick. Trick? I thought you said it was real. Man was real, he wouldn't be here. Maybe this is all he could be. This, and nothing more. Nothing more than just a man. Fake. Cheap fake. Don't pay them no mind. Me, I know what you got is real. And you, what do you want to see? All the undressed women my poor eyes could stand. And you? What about you, Mr. Mentallo? First, money. And then, to be able to open my eyes. A wonderful performance. - Green, go get a doctor, quick. - Right. She's got a broken leg. Crane, get some wood for splints and some rope. She's also got two broken ribs. How do you know? Never mind. Take hold of her, it's gonna hurt. Take it easy. - These are all I could find. - They'll do. - The doctor's on his way. - Good. I also saw two broken ribs. Hang on to this while I immobilize this leg. You've got the power, the power to see inside. Shut up. - Here he comes now. Here he is. - Here comes the doctor. Good. He can take over. - You ain't no mind-reader. - No? But I know what you are. What am I? You're a healer. A healer of the sick. I watched you over there. You looked right through that girl and you knew what was wrong. A broken leg shows. But not broken ribs. I couldn't see nothing. Don't you understand? It means money, more money than you could make in 10 years working on the pier. You can heal them just by laying on your hands. You're out of your mind. But you can look right through a guy and see what's wrong with him, can't you? You said you wanted money, didn't you? We could set up a place in the city. Nothing fancy, no advertising. Just through word. When you're poor, the word gets around about a man that can heal just by looking. And we don't charge them a thing, not one penny. What about your money then, Mr. Crane? Donations, Mr. Mentallo. Everybody gives what he can. Just what he can. Here it is. It ain't much, but you said it don't matter. Any other rooms? Two, the bedroom and another storage room about half the size of this one. - Let's see them. - Right. The one in the back is the storage room. Wait. I'll tell you this once, and that's all. You will never enter these rooms. Never, under any circumstances. All right, all right. Whatever you say, Doc. He's there. It's just like I said, honest. I'm afraid, Mr. Crane. Now, you come along. Maybe he will, maybe he won't. - He's asleep. - It won't take a second. Healer, I brought you someone. Who are you? It's me, Crane. Don't you remember? Yes. Crane. I didn't mean to wake you. I brought Mrs. Mart. This is her. She says she's pained and sick to death. I thought you might be willing to tell her something. I have this pain in my back. It's tight, like a fist. And it grows. I think it's a cancer come to eat me. It's nothing. Nothing. Just tiredness and age, and nothing. And the pain? It'll be gone soon. I was afraid, but you are a good man. She's going. She's beyond my help. She said you were a good man. I guess she knows. She's a smart old woman. She'll pass the word. What? You're a healer. You can heal. I can't heal. I only look. And I tell what I see. Sure. I know what you mean, Doc. But that's enough. You wait and see. In one week's time, this place will be so packed you'll be turning them away. The effects of the compound are still unpredictable. At times, I can see through walls, through stone just as easily as I can see through the air. At other times, I can hardly penetrate the first layer of a man's skin. Sometimes I wonder why I keep on searching. I don't want power or fame or... I told you never to set foot in here. Yeah. You got quite a setup here. You got people waiting, lots of them. I'll be with them in a minute. You better come now. Here he is now. Here he is. All right, everybody, just take it easy. The healer will see everybody in a few minutes. You, miss. Hey, hey, you ain't in line. I'm his friend. I never saw you before. I've never been here before. Hey! Sit down. There's nothing wrong with you, young lady. You're perfectly healthy. Why are you here? To see you, Jim. - Diane? - Yes. How did you find me? I left the foundation, took up my practice again. Patients. First one, then others. They came to me for treatment knowing exactly what was wrong with them. Only one man could tell them that. It took me more than a month to find you, but I knew who I was looking for. I didn't want to see you again. But I'm here now. Yes. If what I'm seeing is really you. No, don't. It's worse without them. - The \"X\" effect? - Yes. Double. Sometimes triple. And sometimes, when I look up and I see all those people above me, pressing down upon me, the whole of humanity. And at night, while they sleep, I close my eyes and I can still see through my own eyelids. Oh, Lord. I'd give anything, anything to have dark. I've come to help, if I can. You can't go on like this. They're bound to discover you. You've got to go away somewhere where it's safe. No, no. You ain't going nowhere. I'm not letting you go. Not when things are just starting to pay off. Haven't you had enough out of their misery? Only my share. My share for keeping you out of the hands of the cops. I've got my power over you, Mr. Mentallo. Dr. James Xavier. I've known about you for some time. Ever since we hit this town. But I don't care. As long as I get my share. Get out of my sight. Get out of my way! You leave now and I'll turn you in, that's what I'll do. I'll see you hang, you murderer! No, you're not gonna get out of here. I'll tell you that. You're not gonna get out. You won't get away! He ain't no healer. He ain't. He looks inside you and he gives you the sickness. And you die! Killer! - Murderer! - Watch out! Murderer! Police, police! What do you see? This city, as if it were unborn, rising into the sky with fingers of metal, limbs without flesh, girders without stone, signs hanging without support, wires dipping and swaying without poles. A city unborn, its flesh dissolved in an acid of light. A city of the dead. Diane, I'm sorry, but I've got to get away. I must go somewhere I can work, where I can solve this thing, - learn to control it. - Where? Anywhere. Across the border, anywhere where I can work. - It'll take money. - I know. Would you come with me? Yes. You know, across the desert is a place where they have more money than I'll ever need. And I can get it. As a matter of fact, I'm the only man in the world, probably, who can get it and get away with it. You wait here. I'll be back in a moment. You've taken the drug again. I had to. The effect is wearing down. Are you all right? For what I have to do, yes. Come on. Are you nearly finished with this machine? This machine's nearly finished me. It's set to jackpot in two plays. Here. - I don't gamble. - This is not gambling. Well, what next? Over there. Eighteen. Can't win them all, darling. Hit me. Fine. Twenty. Pay the point. Twenty-one. You don't seem very worried. It's the house's money. Ain't mine, win or lose. Blackjack. Blackjack pays one-and-a-half times. Hit me. - He can't lose. - Again. Once more. Fine. Twenty. Twenty-one. This table is closed. All right, I'll play over at that table, then. Give me your bag. Jim, you've got enough, nearly $20,000. I could go on winning forever. They can't stop me from winning. I'll show you how to win. Now, wait a minute. - Deal. - Cut. I believe you. I stand. Don't draw. Don't draw. Why not? Because you've got 16 there. The next card's a face card. Jim, please, we'd better cash in and get out of here. All right. Pay me. Pardon me, sir, I'd like to ask you a few questions. Questions? You won a lot of money. I'd like to make sure you won it honestly. - What's it matter to you? - Jim. Look! Look! - No. - Look at his eyes. - What's the matter with him? - No! No! Look at his eyes. No! Something's real wrong with this one. Harry, you better go for the sheriff right now. Jim, they're calling the police. It's free. It's free. Hey, hey, what are you doing? Attention, James Xavier. This is the California Highway Patrol. Attention. You can't escape. I repeat, you can't escape. All forces have been alerted. Give yourself up. Stop and give yourself up. All roads are blocked. Let me sing hallelujah When he comes, hallelujah Let me sing hallelujah Let me sing hallelujah Let me sing hallelujah Let me sing hallelujah Let me sing hallelujah On that day - Hallelujah! - Hallelujah! The children of God. Amen. For we are truly God's children. Hallelujah. He will guard and protect us against the ravages of sin. Amen. Now tell me, whom do we love? The Lord! Yes, we love the Lord. And what do we hate? Sin! Yes, we hate sin. We must destroy it. Hallelujah. And how shall we save our souls? Go forth. Then come forward and save your soul. Come forward and save your soul. Are you a sinner? Do you wish to be saved? Saved? No. I've come to tell you what I see. There are great darknesses, farther than time itself. And beyond the darkness, a light that glows and changes. And in the center of the universe, the eye that sees us all. No! You see sin and the Devil. But the Lord has told us what to do about it. Said Matthew in Chapter Five, \"If thine eye offends thee, \"pluck it out.\" Pluck it out! Pluck it out! Pluck it out! Pluck it out? Pluck it out! Pluck it out! Pluck it out! Pluck it out! Pluck it out! Pluck it out!", "url": "https://subslikescript.com/movie/X_The_Man_with_the_X-Ray_Eyes-57693"},

(2016) - full transcript", "plot": "Documentary sequel that offers a close-up look into the personal lives of the legendary porn stars who've survived the test of time and influenced popular culture. Blends rare interviews ...", "transcript": "foodval.com - stop by if you're interested in the nutritional composition of food   ---  \n        Porn now is a lot more mainstream. - Fuck, yeah. - Yes, yes, yes! It's allowed me to live a really great life. - Bam! - We're performers. Just like The Rock and Vin Diesel are action performers. She was beautiful, her scenes were hot, and she was a party girl. The stigma against porn is kind of what drew me to porn. The time in which you might be stigmatized- - by casting someone from the adult film industry I think is just gone. Now you have to bring so much more to be so much less of a name. He was the perfect porn-star. \n \n \n \n    (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n \n There was just something very innocent- - about us getting naked and having sex on camera. That's why I attribute my longevity to just a lot of classical movies- - from the golden era, and also a lot of mainstream. We realize people have no idea that these are real- - flesh and blood people that're working. It's porn. You're in it. That's it. Adult film stars are just that, Stars. Most people can name one porn-star, - and everybody's seen 'em in action at least once, - and more than that if they're being honest. That makes adult film stars celebrities. Take it from me. I'm Mr. Skin and I filled my own internet empire- - by sharing naked celebrities with the world at large. \n \n \n \n    (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n \n And tonight we're gonna meet some of the greatest adult film stars of all time. Now, what makes them the greatest? Is it their looks, their sexual prowess, their longevity in the industry, - their ability to cross over to the mainstream? Or is it a combination of all of these things? Well, everyone on this list checks many of those boxes- - as we salute the most famous, most fascinating... ...and all around hottest adult film stars in history. Let's kick it off with some of the most popular porn-stars of all time. When fans name their favorite adult performers... ...these names come right off the tips of everyone's tongues. It's a hall of fame hotter than anything in plain old Hollywood. Fuck me. Yeah. Yeah. Tori was a very strong performer that really kind of blew up very quickly- - and became one of those girls who that year, those two years won everything. I know that Tori has won the Back to Back Female Performer of the Year awards. She's kinky and gorgeous. You can't get any better than that. One of the best natural bodies in the business. Um, and when she's on sexually, wow. Growing up and being really boyish, - I never really imagined that I would be a model at all. Any type of model, let alone this type. This industry really gave me a chance to be my deviant self. Curb your tongue, funny man. She was very good, uh, in front of the camera. Like she has that kind of mainstream believability. Yeah, yeah. Oh. When I appeared on \"Ray Donovan,\" - um, when I came to set, and everybody was very welcoming- - and very warm and curious about the industry. Ooh. Ricky? Camera down. - Hey! - Ugh! I really feel like women's sexuality has been lost in the dark ages, - and I feel like it's really starting to evolve. I want to leave behind that empowering feeling for women. I want women to know that it's okay to be sexual. I want women to know that you can be classy- - and graceful and elegant and smart and sophisticated, and a freak. Like you don't have to leave that off the list- - in order to be the other things. If you have all those things and you're a freak, you are unstoppable. I think Christy is a superstar. I don't think there's any question. I think Christy's a big star for a lot of reasons. - First of all... - She had massive tits. And that always helps. And they were natural. Natural massive tits. And that helps ever more. How I became a star in this business- - is beyond me, but when I look back, - you had to like me 'cause there were only four of us to choose from. I was like, - the big titted girl next door. She was genuinely a very stunning, beautiful woman, - so I don't think it was solely just 'cause there was only a few of them. You know, that first time was with Ron Jeremy, I mean, and it was so porno-y. She knew how to talk dirty during sex. She just sort of knew what was on your mind. - Do you wanna fuck me? - Oh, yeah. Do you wanna stick your cock in my pussy? She was a good comedienne. She doesn't take herself too seriously. You get your makeup done, - you suck a dick, you'd have a catered lunch. So if it was my choice, she probably would've been my number one pick back in the day. She had it all. I'm Christy Canyon. Back in, back in the day, goddammit, that meant something. It was like the perfect storm. She could act, she wanted to do it, - her scenes were good, she had giant boobs. I just always like morphed into something else in this business. I mean, from making films to dancing to writing my book to radio for ten years, - I just showed up, did my job, had great sex and got my $200- - and felt like I owned the world. I started doing adult films in 1999. You know, in the beginning, she kind of looked like- - a Vietnamese war vet without makeup. You put makeup on her and she had a soft body- - and all natural and gorgeous boobs. Because for so long we really only exploited the sexuality- - of people that had fake boobs and blonde hair. I feel like Tera Patrick was like just a magnificent supermodel. She came off very confident, - and like her body and her gorgeousness matched it. You know, we never really stayed in the adult bubble when we were marketing her. We thought we can get her out there to everybody. This girl is somebody that everybody will love, and everybody did. She was on the cover of \"FHM\" and the cover of \"Maxim\"- - and all the men's magazines. When I started independently, I did a lot of gonzo movies, - and I remember fans always saying, - oh my gosh, why are you doing Gonzo movies? You should be doing these like big features. And I was like, are you kidding me? I just wanna go and have sex. It really was about the sex. I think I was one of her first Girl/Girl scenes, - so I was just more nervous on the fact of, you know, - she's Tera Patrick, and she's so much taller than me, too. Like my face was at her vagina. What I liked about working with Vivid was it was the first time where I actually- - completely got creative control over everything I wanted to do in a movie. She's bright and she's articulate, and she's very creative. Ooh, yeah, right. Uh, yeah, you're on my clit. But I've been asked, would you ever come back to porn? What if someone just dropped a million dollars right there- - and said, you and Rocco can have sex in Egypt on the pyramids. I still wouldn't do it. There was only so far I could go, - and I feel like ten years is a good amount of time- - and a long time to be in the porn business. Seka is amazing. She's my all time favorite actress of that era. She's very glamorous. She was strictly business. All business. Very smart girl. She kind of reminded me like of a trashy version of Marilyn Monroe. Would you like to suck on my tits, huh, right there? Ooh. What made me different than anybody else at the time? For one thing, I was the first platinum blonde. I mean, there were other blondes, but not screaming blonde hair. She was working at a porn store, - and she was watching the porn and thought to herself, - I could do way better than this. They have really dirty feet, and they've got pimples on their butts. I said, this is really nasty. I went and made my first adult movie, - and I don't think there was even sound at the time. It was in color, though. I mean, I'm old, but I'm not that old, so it was in color. And having owned adult bookstores, - I knew the stars in the business when I went on set, - and I just felt like a big piece of meat on a hook. \"Prisoner of Paradise\" was kind of fun. I played a German Nazi bitch with a really bad German accent. But I thought, no, she's a southern girl. How's she gonna do a Nazi? But she did. Don't you cum in me, you American swine. Don't cum in me, you American swine. ♪ Oh, seka ♪ ♪ Tried on some sexy clothes ♪ The film itself, \"Inside Seka,\" was an incredibly popular film- - simply because it was one of the films that had been made- - sort of when that porno chic period was ending. And the reason why they were so important is because they were star-centric. Seka has sex with about 20 different guys. She also was given $10,000 as her pay. Around 1982, I decided to stop performing. AIDS was starting to become a real big issue for me. I'd worked for \"Club\" magazine after that for about ten years- - and I traveled around the world stripping, - and I had a great time and made a butt-load of money. I always thought she looked like Raquel Welch when she was younger. So she was beautiful, her scenes were hot, and she was a party girl. That's a really good combination, for a superstar. She wasn't about making movies. She was about fucking. She would show up and just want to have sex, and do her best at that. We can lay music over this, right? - Yeah. - Great. You don't mind just fucking me. Action. The pickin's weren't like it is today. It's not like now where the beautiful hot chicks are a dime a dozen. So I was fresh meat. I was excited about my work. January of '89 I had my first contract with Vivid- - on the back of a cocktail napkin at the Tropicana. It was that simple. Tori Welles was one of the first home video stars of her era. She was then contracted with Vivid, - who loaned her out to Andrew Blake to make \"Night Trips.\" The idea of \"Night Trips\" basically came from my art direction- - and fashion design background. And, uh, I just wanted to make the most beautiful movies that I could- - with the most beautiful talent that was available at the time. He really made her the star like putting her in almost every single scene. It was one of a kind, and it was the most beautiful porn every made at that time. She was like pure sex and a mile wide. It was very trans-formative during that period, and she was at the right time, - the right place, with the right people. The success of \"Night Trips\" it just happened before my eyes, - probably because of the beauty, and sexual prowess of Tori Welles. I made a name accidentally, but because of the drug addiction- - and because of the felonies, and because of things like that, - you're not always able to move on, - you know, so you come back to the adult tit, so to speak. I mean, I had gone from being Tori Welles to like being a P.A. It's like talk about humiliating. So, you know, some of it was good, and some of it was bad, you know. Some of it was stupid. You know, you don't get into this business if, - you know, you're completely got your shit together. You just don't, and I don't care what anybody says. Uh, I actually started working at Hooters when I was 17 years old. You were supposed to be 18, but I kind of was naturally big. Somebody was trying to scout me. They were like, why haven't you done \"Playboy\"? And I was like, I'd rather do porn. And I flew out to L.A. Literally it was on a Friday, - and by the time I came home Sunday, I had a signed contract with Digital Playground. She was almost a star from the moment we signed her. So it wasn't so much a matter of making Jesse Jane a star. It was just a matter of showing the world. And at the time, Seymore Butts had his show, \"Family Business,\" - so he followed me around like a little puppy dog. I have finally tracked you down. Do you know how many times I have seen you? Every time you catch my eye, and I wanna zoom up over to you, - but you disappear as quick as you appear. And now that I just saw you, I just feel like, I just felt like I just had to like get you- - while I knew you were cornered. Are you planning on... Honey, I need you to do an interview. Come do an interview. And then from then, they were like, yep, she's made for porn. She's definitely, you know what? We made a right decision. It's mine to ride when I'm fucking you. Oh, yes. I want the whole package. I want it all. I wanna be the next star. Like the team that I had behind me, - like the marketing and everything was genius. Marketing her was simple. I mean, one image would elicit so many responses- - from the media, and then once people met her in person, - you know, she never disappointed. I saw her do a Girl/Girl in the \"Pirates\" movie that was really intense. It was basically like sex fighting, and I've never seen anything like that. - Fuck, yeah? - I Wanna kiss you. - Yeah? - Slap me harder. Yeah? Yeah? I think that's sort of the quintessential barbie almost. Barbie's been everything. She's been an astronaut. She's been, she's been everything in between. So, yeah, there you go, The Ultimate Porn Barbie. It's all I wanted. Like I wanted to be known as the sex symbol you'll always remember. That when I get out of the business, you'll still know the name Jesse Jane. The average lifespan of an adult female performer's career- - is less than two years, but this next group of stars- - have careers that span from 20 to over 30 years. Now, why have these knockouts lasted in an industry- - that always looks for the next big thing? Because these are the golden goddesses- - whose beauty, passion, and raw sexuality- - transcends all elements, including time. One of the reasons for my longevity is I just would not leave- - when they all wanted me to after five years. Once I hit 30, they sort of, I mean, - I got the AVN Lifetime Achievement Award in 1989. It's like you trying to tell me something? When you watch her fuck on film, it is genuine. She also just has that something, that star quality. Nina Hartley really resonates with so many people- - that have become her ardent fans over the years- - because she's so accessible, and she's so honest, and she's so fearless. I've been able to maintain a 30-year-plus career because I basically love the work. But the first time I saw sex onscreen- - my inner cookie monster just said: \"Me want do that.\" Like she had a, uh, kind of a cameo in \"Boogie Nights\"- - that like she really showed what she's made of- - when she does a little bit more mainstream stuff. She played William Macy's wife. She was kind of a sexual free spirit in the movie. She cuckolded him many, many times. What the fuck are you doing? What the fuck does it look like I'm doing? Can you close the door? That's my wife, you asshole. For a sex worker, when they try to go out- - and give sex education, to be taken seriously, - I think no one is taken more seriously than Nina. There's her vagina, her urethra, and her clit. So how can I be a feminist and be a sex worker? The bottom line is my body, my rules. And the message on that was whatever you wanna do is okay. That women should not be judged- - for being in this business and being on set- - and having sex with a different person every day. The energy coming at me, the laws coming at me from both the religious right- - and the so-called feminist left are exactly the same. They're prohibitionary. Um, one doesn't want me to have an abortion, and one does not want me to sell- - the services of my vulva for money. I'm a Trojan horse for queer culture. I'm a bisexual, I am kinky and all these things, - but I dress up normal, I look very straight, - and my most fun times are when I get my face- - between the legs of a gay-for-pay girl- - and get a real response out of her. It's like, yes, I am that good. Her being with wicked for so long- - was a lot of the reason for the longevity in her career, and her evolution. I think she's hotter now than she was 15 years ago. But then when you go beyond her physical aspects, - she's a good voice and an advocate for our industry. Because Jessica has been in, so many blockbuster adult movies, - she's one of the few modern adult stars recognizable to the average consumer. Oh, fuck. I was a stripper. I had the luck to run into Blondage, which was Janine and Julia Ann. And I saw them onstage and something clicked. Yeah. A few people from wicked called me, and then I agreed to sign with them. And I also came to realize that the more I personally have to do with the movie, - the happier I am with the outcome. So she won Best Actress, and won this great Hardcore Scene Award. And I think that defines Jessica along the way as well. Even at adult star signings, women are getting in line and telling her- - their sex concerns and issues and problems. And then they started asking me for sex advice, so I saw this opening- - for a different kind of sex-ed, or a different kind of instructional. Jessica drake is unique. For one thing, DVD sales are dying, and her movies still sell great. She's a spokesperson for Wicked, - she's a spokesperson for the entire adult industry. She's a successful sex educator, - has had a ton of mainstream appearances, - and, oh, by the way, still has time, for all her philanthropy. So she's truly unique amongst today's stars. Working with her, the scenes were over way too quickly, - and then, of course, I'm masturbating in my car- - thinking about her driving home. But, PFST, sex with Kylie? Perfect. She's just such a strong, powerful, um, artistic, - and visionary woman in my mind. You know, if she wanted to come back and do films now, - which I would absolutely be there if she would, - she could and she would kill it- - just as if it was 10 or 15 or even 20 years ago. So I suppose you could say I started kind of in this business, - but not in this business when I worked in a video store in San Diego, - and I was in charge of ordering adult movies. And they said, okay, this is randy west you're gonna be working with him, I'm like, - yeah, okay, I know who you are. And I was extremely nervous. I never thought in a million years that I would win best new starlet. I was thrilled that I was nominated. Kylie Ireland. And I have to thank all the people that have believed in me. It was '95 maybe that I signed a contract with Sin City. We started shooting movies, - and we were supposed to do like basically I think it was a movie a month. And suddenly none of us shot anything. I decided I was gonna go to small claims court. I didn't realize at this point that that's where \"Judge Judy\" picked up their cases. You are about to enter the courtroom of judge Judith Sheindlin. Kylie Ireland is an adult movie star. She's suing this producer for breach of contract. - She's not some airhead. - Thank you. And I'm awarding $5,000 to the plaintiff. Remember, there was no internet at the time. Adult stars didn't end up on reality shows. That catapulted her to another level. She was already popular, but now she's, - mainstream people are going, well, who's this women on \"judge Judy\"? She's incredible behind the camera. That's when I started doing production design. I just always wanted to say, I won art direction, - and that didn't happen until we did \"Star Wars XXX.\" I find your lack of faith disturbing. My life is so weird. Sometimes I just sit here and I go, my life is so strange. How bizarre is my life that this is what I'm doing right now? Up till now, we've met some the greatest female stars- - of all time. But you may be asking yourself, where are the men? Okay, let's bring on the biggest studs, - in every sense, in the history of the adult business. We start with john C. Holmes, - whose claim to fame rested between his legs. - Are you really twin brothers? - No, not really. Same father, different mothers. Oh, what a mess. Will someone come here and change the sheet here? Oh, this is disgusting. Oh, that's the same hand, isn't it? - Yeah. - Oh, god. John Holmes definitely impacted pop culture. And especially in the '70s, he was it. He was like a sight to see. 14 inches. And they all wanted to see it. That's what John was. He was a freak. I was sitting there editing, and my partner comes out and he says, Bob, - you gotta come in and see this guy's dick. Wow! I said, man, that's the last thing I wanna do is see a tall skinny guy's dick. I can't paint and I can't draw and I can't sculpt. So I have to have some outlet for my fake artistic qualities. My name is Johnny Wadd. I'm a private detective. It was one of those slow days- - where there was very little money and very little pussy. Basically they get involved with me, for one of one reason. And, uh, it doesn't go beyond that. He quite literally didn't have to do anything, but be John Holmes. He came onto camera and he sat down- - and he leaned back and the girl did what she did. He would say, how much film you got? And have my cameraman could count down, and he could cum on cue. He was that good back in the early days. Not so much later. Why do you stay in the bathroom, for five hours at a time on sets? I don't know. It's a shitty habit. There was a time when he was very troubled. He'd been using drugs a lot, - and the reason we shot \"Prisoner of Paradise\"- - on Kauai was because I thought- - if we can get him away from Los Angeles, it might help him, and it did. His goal in life was just to see- - how many people he could fuck over as fast as he could- - and get out of town without getting killed. On the wonderland murders, Eddie Nash was this very big drug dealer, and john had hooked up. Uh, they heisted all the money and all the drugs from Eddie, - and Eddie found out it was John- - who got him in trouble, - and Eddie said, John's dead. He's like running around the country evading police. They catch him Florida. He's in jail and there's petty theft- - and there's burglary and then there's drug dealing- - and there's pimping and then he's prostituting himself. He's prostituting his girlfriend. He's all over the place doing whatever he can- - to basically keep this habit alive that he has- - that I don't think he ever quite overcame. We the jury, in the above entitled action, - find the defendant, John Curtis Holmes, not guilty of murder. When it came out that he did have AIDS, the shit hit the fan. In the industry that's pretty much the worst thing you can do. You're jeopardizing people's lives, and especially back then. AIDS was a death sentence. It wasn't something you managed. He just told them he had the flu. Typical of John to lie to everybody. Thank god none of them got sick. He was the ultimate gigolo, The ultimate Playboy. The ultimate con man, and that's what he was. Let's go. I want you to brief me before I get involved in this. Yes, sir. He's a consummate professional. He's one of the few guys- - that's had a great balance between, um, chemistry- - and, and raw sexual energy. You know, like he's found a way to be a black man and not come on set- - with like, you know, a bunch of chains and jewelry- - and like an entourage, you know. He comes in, he has a hard dick, he lays it down and, you know, - he leaves a smile on your face. And it's so funny, 'cause he's the sweetest guy. Like he's just really mellow, - and then all of a sudden, he pulls out this monster. Very early out of college I got into finance, - and so I became the proverbial wall street stockbroker, for six years. The broker that trained me brought me to a party, - which was a 19-on-1 gangbang. So I got kind of used to having sex in front of people- - at a very early part of my adulthood. That's why a lot of people buy his stuff, - 'cause they're like, I wanna watch Lex specifically fuck girls. It was just me being myself, but the key ingredient was the casting. Always the absolute best female talent- - available at the moment we were shooting. I think that he is the most successful black performer ever- - because he's just so consistent and so driven. I won Male Performer of The Year 2000, 2002, and 2003, - and one of the things I've gotten out of it- - that has been perhaps more impactful in my life- - has been that I've been the only black performer- - to have won Performer of The Year Award male or female. He's probably one of the few successful black performers- - that owns his own company, and to me, that was very inspiring. For Lex to take his name, and then spin off and do other things, you know. He has his own podcast. He has his own talk show, you know, he has his own toy line. I'm in my 15th year in the major leagues, right, - and it's not really a case where I feel that I'm getting tired of performing, - you know, despite the fact that I may now be more than twice the age- - of some of the youngest performers I work with. I love the fact that, you know, I get to do this. And there's actually a renewed vigor, for performance that I'm undergoing- - because I've gotten to the point where I realize there's only a few guys globally- - that get a chance to perform, and be regarded as the main dudes. I appreciate being a performer more now than when I started my career. Yeah, when I started in Europe, so the three first years I did only in France. So I had to make a choice. I was done with school. What do I do now? Like am I starting being a teacher- - or if I do that, I'm gonna have to really focus on that. He's just very controlling, but passionate in the same way. He's one of the few men that I will let be rough with me, and take me into that level. I think that he's the perfect performer, for every girl to work with- - because he teaches you a lot about yourself while working with him. People started doing like the rough stuff, and the gonzo things, - and he kind of like threw himself in headfirst. Once the sex started, it just like seemed to go really naturally- - and it was easy to just like tell him like, - oh, I have no limits. You can do whatever you want. It was really cool. It was like a roller-coaster. - Oh, fuck, yes. Yes, yes. - Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, the first time I had sex with Manuel, I was super nervous. I was shaking and he had to keep asking me if I was okay and if I could go through with this. I was like, yeah, you just don't understand you're a huge deal. Like when I was 18, I was watching you fuck other women. I'm gonna cum. I've done so many scenes with Manuel, it kind of blurs together. At the point, you know when you're gonna die, and your life flashes before your eyes? It would just be lots of dicks, but Manuel would be in there a lot. So I won AVN male performer of the year six times. Uh, one of them I think was, uh, foreign performer of the year. Like it's like basketball. Like everyone can play basketball. Not everyone's gonna be Kobe. We're talking about good sex down here. Rocco's up there, you know. Just like doing all sorts of crazy passionate, hard fucking. And my first movie with john was \"Buttman Ultimate Workout.\" John, you know what kind of girl I like. I like a girl with the big, round, culo ass. This is the most successful series I ever done. I mean, john for me has really been a mentor. I think every male performer has Rocco in some way as a role model. He just exudes sexuality, - and you can't put your finger on what that is, right? That's just a thing. That's a DNA thing. When Rocco came along, you realized, oh, I can get a phenomenal sex scene. He will make this girl look really, really good. He'll make her look better than in any other movie. Since I was very teeny, very young, I had this kind of fire inside. I remember I was 13, jerking off, jerking off, jerking off, and the doctor, I remember, - was very angry, told me, hey, man, stop the jerk off. Otherwise you never, you will never get better. His performance was 30 different than anything else. He never broke eye contact. Well, my first Boy/Girl scene was with the infamous Rocco Siffredi. I didn't know his type of scenes, how aggressive they are. Speaking to me in Italian. It was great 'cause he, he, he made love to me. You know, I did two movies in french, which was not porn, it was mainstream. It was an incredible experience. Catherine come back with the movie, for me as main star. A gay guy prostitute for the first time make love with a woman. One of the best experience in my life. Elegance, style, grace, sexuality, intensity. I love that guy. And when you fuck a woman, you put your soul. You don't fuck the girl just with the dick. Woman, you need to fuck them in the brain if you want to bring something out of them. Oh, my god. In many ways both positive and negative, - the adult industry mirrors mainstream entertainment. Like Hollywood, the adult film industry- - has been correctly criticized for its lack of diversity. Performers, directors, and producers of color have been too rare in times past. But today, performers of color are starting to break through more regularly- - and controlling their own careers both in front and behind the camera. These next trailblazers made that possible- - by working through the inherent prejudice in the sex business- - and forging successful and even legendary careers. Misty Stone, so she came across as like funny, interesting, vivacious, and cool. Like totally cool. And it's really cool to see a woman of color- - in the industry that's not your typical like 34DD with a gigantic big old booty. And she's like petite and sensual, and just on fire. I think I just fell into the adult films. After awhile, it became more of a career decision because I loved it so much, - I wanted to be the best at it. The \"Men In Black\" parody, that movie was amazing. The special effects, the makeup was outrageous. So many girls that do Girl/Girl, like not to spoil the party, are not into Girl/Girl. I was so nervous, because, you know, like she's, she's my mentor like. When you kind of get to work with one of your idols, - you're just like, I hope they're into it. By the time we were like five minutes into it, - once we're kissing and stuff, I felt so there with her. She was one of those girls that would like would flirt before the scene- - is in the makeup chair feeling on you. Just really immediately kind of pulling me in. But now in my personal life, I got to have some dick, baby. Oh, I'm gonna cum. Being a ebony model in the business, - you kind of have a sort of like a different journey in a way, - you know, because the opportunities are different. You kind of have to really know how to carry yourself- - and know how to present yourself to the right people, - and I feel like misty has done that from the very beginning. When I started, I was told to follow Misty Stone- - as a role model, and I'm glad that I have. It's not based on popularity. It's, it's, it's based on your skin tone, baby. Say a new girl coming into the industry, and she's very dark skinned. Well, then you also have another new girl coming in the industry, - and she's a little bit more lighter skinner. Well, guess what? That lighter skinned young Lady- - is gonna get a lot more work than the darker skinner young Lady, - and that's just how it is. Now, another example would be, well, we have this young white girl- - who's gonna get 1,500 for this scene, - but I think we're gonna give this young black young Lady- - 800 for the scene, and that's just how it is. Even our own black people do it to us, and that's even sadder. That they downgrade us when they should be uplifting us. She's a character. I've brought my little sister to a scene, and it was back in the day. It was my first gangbang I ever did in my whole life. I just needed support, - and I thought that that's what family's supposed to do was be there and support you. But I don't think they're supposed to be there and support you- - when you're getting gang-banged by six or seven guys. Vanessa being the first official Latin porn-star. Wow. She is a true pioneer. She is a trailblazing superwoman that I have just, I can identify with. You talk about staying power and star power, she's, I mean, - she might be one of the most, you know, the more iconic. And I guess that's also has to do with that Latin heat. Wild, wild fucking. Nice, nice, very nice woman. Cubans are wild. Mm... I guess I was, I was like the first woman of color in the business. They saw that there was a market for it because I became so popular so fast. She had a following from day one, and she was smart enough to realize it- - and she was one of the first women to get $1,000 a day, - which was unheard of at that point. Most of the women were working for 300, 350, in that neighborhood. Hey, wait a minute. He's your husband, and you've got five minutes to finish him off and go home. I have to go to work. I did waitress. I did go-go. I did stripping. I did hooking. I did the whole 42nd street stroll, which was fun. My first movie was \"China Doll.\" Vanessa Del Rio, the inventor of the DP. I'll take the title, but I'm sure that there was double penetration going on before me. Come on, baby. Stick it in. Come on. And I blew the cameraman. Ooh! In my first movie. That's what the '70s was like. I liked the seedy environment, and the way a peep show smelled, you know, - with the Clorox and cum. The live sex shows took place at show world. David Christopher, I think he had like a bunch of guys and girls, - like couples that wanted to see a couple fuck. Just, you know, being surrounded by a bunch of gawkers, you know, men and women. So if you wanna know why my clit was so big, was because I did body building, - and, yes, I did steroids. Doing the steroids and the side effects that's I don't recommend. But having a big clit from it, yeah. What woman wouldn't? I mean, it looks like a little dick. I suppose it is perverse, letting them believe I can't speak English and all. She would only get typecast as the, the maid. No matter how great she looked, how glamorous. Very early on, it was a white industry, - so here I come with my, you know, - bigger than life like, you know, big hair, and you know, like that. And so I was noted as first Latina. Pretty good, no? Vanessa Del Rio is an inspiration to girls like me in the industry- - that are of Latin descent, you know, because she didn't let that hold her back. She owned it. Oh, yess, yes, yes. Asa Akira is certainly a character like no other. 30 my first job in the adult entertainment world was as a dominatrix when I was 19 years old. I was just walking down the street one day, and this guy just stopped me on the street- - and asked me, would you be interested in being in the adult entertainment industry? And I was like, yes. And I followed him upstairs to his dungeon. The next day, I started training to be a dominatrix. So I'm really lucky. I mean, he could have killed me. That is her 100% of the time. She has no filter. She is the beginning of what I feel like what made, made this business step outside the box. In 2013, I signed an exclusive contract with Wicked Pictures. Probably the first girl I signed that already was a huge star. Wicked shoots really beautiful, high budget, like glamorous stuff. So the AVN awards were one of the few things- - I actually knew about porn coming in, so it was really exciting to be asked to host the event. That same night that I hosted the awards, I won Female Performer of The Year. All: Asa Akira. Oh, my god. Yes. I wanted this so fucking bad. I got this theory that the reasons there are never that many Asian girls - in the industry at any given time is 'cause for most of us, - like the second our family finds out, that's it. That's worked out to my advantage. Like I got to be in a lot of movies as the Asian girl. And I think that's very wrong. I think she is very much, whether she was Asian or not is an amazing performer. And she really is gonna be one of the last big stars of porn. Like I said, she would go to a shoot to do an anal shoot- - and end up doing a gangbang by accident. There was a lot of accidents on her sets, - but I guess happy accidents for the directors. You know, like I always tell people like I'm the best case scenario in porn. Found love. I've found a career. Um, I've never been taken advantage of. Last year I had a memoir published. Uh, it's titled \"insatiable: Porn a love story.\" And that's like exactly how I feel about the industry. It's, it's, it's been a love story. Um, as cheesy as that sounds. The modern adult star is a much different breed than those in the past. 25 years ago, tattoos and piercings were taboo. Sex acts performed in movies- - rarely included bondage, discipline, or S&M. Today, some of the biggest adult stars- - are what we might call alternative. But even as the alternative blends into mainstream, - these stars stand out with their unique styles- - and no fears, no limits approach... To sex. - You like my blazer? - Oh, yeah. She was going to make herself a brand, - and she wanted to shoot hot tattooed girls- - and alternative styles, which was very different from what you were typically seeing. Why I think Joanna is such a big star- - is because that she doesn't try to change her style- - where it's like, well, they're doing that, - so we should start doing that. It's like, - no, this is what works for us. And that's what her fans love. Joanna angel has always been a person- - who I've looked up to in the industry. Someone who started her own business when she was in college. I don't think it was me that actually came up with burning angel, - but I did say I wanted some kind of good girl, bad girl thing. I didn't know anything about porn. I had never watched a porn. I knew nothing about the industry. I didn't even really know that porn was an industry. I mean, this was 13 or 14 years ago. There was no Twitter, there was no Instagram. You could not just log on to anywhere on the internet- - and find out what porn-stars do every day. So I guess I was the first girl- - to have her own hardcore video porn site. So we got a lot of press when we first started. I wasn't expecting to be a figurehead, for punk and porn and feminism. I wanted to do everything, - so the first scene I ever did I had anal sex, - and that was only like the third time I even did it in my whole life. - here's what happens when a website becomes a movie. I don't know if anyone really got it. So Tommy pistol, it was his first scene and my first scene. He kept asking me if, if he would have to shave- - his ass or not if he did the movie. A lot of the sex that we had- - was like in places in new york or Brooklyn, - and sometimes they were out on rooftops- - or in like in school busses- - and with a lot of Hasidic Jews walking around- - wondering what's going on in there? Something I really love about Joanna- - is that she has a really great sense of humor. And so she always brings that piece of herself into her scenes. Thank you, kind sir. And I'll tell you what. I'll even let you put it in my butt. I've now won an AVN award, for best sex comedy three times now. It's kind of where I've sort of found my comfort zone in porn. She also picked up on it really early in her career that if she had her own site, - that she wanted her sites to be the only place you could find Joanna angel fucking. I really hate the term \"Alt Porn,\" - but I do realize that everything in porn needs a category. I got into porn by literally weaseling my way- - into the porn industry, and I'm still here. Pick up a camera, shoot something, - get it out there, you're in porn. There it is. Oh, god, I think I'm gonna cum. I'm gonna cum. Skin diamond is easily one of the greatest crossover, BDSM, and porn performers. I think that's probably why so many people like her- - is because she's not afraid to be herself. She's just as good at receiving flogging and nipple clamps as she is at taking anal. She's very exotic. Like she could be from the future. She could be from the past. She could be from Pangia. I don't know. Oh, yeah. Oh. I was born in California, - but I moved to Scotland when I was three because my dad was a missionary. I wanted to start modeling nude, - which was a big deal, - because at the time, my dad had transitioned- - from being a missionary to a children's tv show host. So it was a, a big scandal. I mean, ten or 20 years ago I don't think somebody could have like- - built their entire career being alternative looking, I would say. She understands being a sex worker in a way that a lot of the newer girls don't get. Not only that, but alternative sex worker by choice. Coming from the fetish scene, you know, it's, it's a very misunderstood group. And then all of a sudden, I was in this environment where the dirtier, the better. Like you wanna do something crazy? Then let's film it. I had her like kind of all tied up and was like- - filming her on like a super 8 camera and being really creepy. And like, I'm gonna be a star. You're my princess. She's the type of person that you want to fuck. With a gun. - No, I'm not lying. - Don't lie to me. No. When I first got in, everyone told me to, - that, again, that my look was too extreme. But it was actually, it actually worked in my favor, - I think, because it made me stand out. I, I think that being a submissive woman- - is a very empowering thing to do um, because you have to be- - really tough, and in the fetish world, it's all about consent. It's not about abuse. I've been very blessed in that I've gotten a lot of mainstream attention. I've actually got to do some really cool stuff. Count to ten. One. Two. Why are you being so gentle? Oh! I have a lot of nerdy pleasures, so I did a whole movie- - where I cos-played different characters from the different worlds. Wind moving through the leaves, bring me harry potter please. A few years ago, I was featured in a marvel comic, the new \"Daredevil\"- - as the reference model to draw echo. Pretty, pretty cool. I'm sorry. I gotta, I gotta hand it to myself. So against what a lot of the industry- - considers to be all odds, she's risen further- - than most people can ever dream of rising. By showing her true self, I think she's a, she's kind of, she's kind of my hero for that. I think it really goes to show how far we've come as human beings right now. Liking crazy sex isn't as unusual for a girl to like sucking cock. Are you not his whore? Both my parents were very religious in the Mormon religion, - so I kind of grew up with that upbringing. I transitioned from Jesus to the adult industry by seeking I think validation. It's refreshing to be around someone- - that is so comfortable with themselves and who they are- - that it makes you feel more comfortable with who you are. She wasn't a fake person in any way, shape or form. And I hate to say it, but in the porn business, - sometimes being somewhat fake with your emotions is a necessity. You think you can handle me? Yeah, I think so. I think I can handle you. I think you need to bend over. The thing that led to belladonna's popularity, - I believe, was when Diane sawyer profiled her on \"Prime Time Live.\" The hatchet job, but people had a lot of empathy for belladonna, - and that opened the door for her success. She says afterwards she was shattered, - but she just didn't know how to refuse. Because I didn't know any better, you know? I had these ideas of fame and attention and money. When she started, if a girl had a tattoo, - more than half the producers wouldn't even hire the person if they had tattoos. And by the time she finished, it was a completely different world. Ahe attention that I was getting from my body was powerful. You know, it was the first time in my life I felt like, wow, like I am sexy. I got an opportunity to direct for evil angel. As a female director who was really the one with the ideas. Because she could be real in those movies, - and she was in a safe, comfortable environment. We were just hanging out and capture what you capture, and that's it. You know, I had never really thought too much about what I was doing. I got these opportunities and I did 'em- - and I was very much in the moment, day to day. And in the height of DVD sales, belladonna was a top seller week after week. In the 1970s and early 1980s, when porn was mostly still shown in movie theaters, - acting was as much a premium as sexual ability. Some of the greatest actors from the golden age of adult cinema were classically trained. Appearing in adult films then became an act of rebellion. Here now are adult cinema's most award worthy dramatic performers. I am compelled to introduce myself. My name is Johnny Dooropener. Howdy, Mr. Dooropener. How did you know who I was? It's my business to know people. John was very innovative. He was the real deal all day. He actually could act, and then he could also do a, a sexual performance, and I think- - to be able to do both was just a pretty rare gift. Of all the male porn-stars in the '70s, he probably sold the most tickets. He was the only actor of that era- - that people came to see because of his acting, and his charisma, - and he was the Clark Gable of his era. At that time, there was no material out there, so they had- - soft-core movies, right, people had soft-core movies, - let's cut in hardcore footage. They'd cut from this film of this guy pretending to fuck this girl, soft-core, - and they'd cut in me fucking the girl, so you get a little in and out. I did five one day, inserts and cum shots. Every time you came, they gave you another fucking $50. And I don't know why they wanted the fourth and fifth one 'cause it was blanks. He just had a way about him that was '80s charismatic. I would say he's like the Clint Eastwood of porn. You just wanted to, to please him. He had swag and he was sexy, and he was, he was like a ladies man. And I feel like women wanted him, and men kind of wanted to be him. Did I give you enough dick? Huh? I give you enough dick? He was the original guy to talk dirty to girls to get where he wanted to get. I bet the police get in your pants all the time, huh? But you gotta watch those cops. They'll fuck you to death. - You ever been fucked in the ass before? - Mm-mm. - Are you curious what it's about? - Mm. It was, it was fun, it was mostly fun because we were best friends. The last two weeks he was alive, he was hanging at joey's, - and, uh, they just understood each other. Well, to be honest, I wish john was even more, - uh, had more of an impact than he was. That's a big problem with this business is that when you are gone in this business, you are gone. I mean, anybody that can do ten pages of script, four costume changes, - and three sex scenes in a ten-hour day, you know, goes to the top of the list. - Oh, yeah, fuck her. - No, I don't think I will. Oh, fuck her like you fuck me, Nick. Making films was a lot different then, and it was huge. Like we would have big red carpet premieres, and you would go into a theater. And if it was a good movie, you could run six weeks, two months, - playing the same movie at a theater. I thought, wow. I could act. All my friends from college weren't acting. I could get paid for it, and I could have sex. It was like, oh, yeah. You always carry around girl's underpants? Yeah, I collect them. Maybe I can give you some of mine sometime. Veronica came across as more intelligent. She came across as more capable, and her scenes came off as very genuine. One of the most favorite roles that I've ever had was in \"Amanda by Night.\" Can you fucking believe that? Oh, no, no. Another reason why I really liked that movie is I actually won best actress. Now if I could ask you a question. Why did your last coordinator leave? She wasn't putting out, uh, she wasn't putting out- - the kinds of results that we were looking for. Mm-hmm. You do have, uh, quite an employment history. \"Wanda Whips Wall Street.\" What a fun movie that was. They actually made a straight film out of it- - called \"Stocks and Blondes.\" We went back and re-shot. You know, Lester, I don't usually go out with men from the office, - but seeing as you're from Tyler's Cleveland branch, - I thought I'd make an exception. Veronica became the quintessential sex goddess, and the actress. And she was still managed to maintain the feeling- - that she was your girlfriend or the friend of your sister's. I did 13 movies one year, and they told me I had ruined my career. And what it did, it just made me more well known. People have a lot to say about this business, - but where else can a female do so many things? I mean, I've done about everything in the business. I was able to act, I was able to direct, - I could produce, I'd been a stylist, I'm still a production manager. Where else? I know the straight business wouldn't afford me that. In a career sense, good actress, sexy gal, somebody that you could, uh, - jerk off to and not feel bad about, - but made you feel good about being a sexual human being- And who really wanted to connect, and really wanted to spread love. Jamie was absolutely the icon of all time. And he's one of the pioneers of modern pornography, a complete and total deviant. Creepy, dirty, nasty, sexy behavior. He was able somehow to, to make it classy. Happened pretty quickly, because once I started working, - uh, it was like an avalanche after about a year, you know, maybe a year. It was like all of a sudden, I was the guy, you know, that, - I mean, there was one point in new york where I counted 14 of my films playing in one day. It's amazing to me that somebody who is famous in the end- - for showing the raw, real side of their sexuality is also an amazing actor. You know, you pulled off quite a neat little trick with that fantasy of yours. - Does that feel good? - Yeah, it's just sex. I am pretty dirty, though, girls. You'll have to work hard. Repent! You must repent! God! Please forgive me! To me, sex was a big drug, if you want to call it that. I was really interested in the sex. The idea that people were getting, drinking or taking pills to, to, you know, - forget the experience they were having on the set, you know, or maybe they felt bad about it. I don't know what they were doing. To me it didn't, it didn't make any sense to me. You know, I was really after the, the piece of ass I was gonna fuck. Men, women, I don't think it mattered to him. Jamie Gillis may have said at times that he was bisexual, - but I think the only label you could put on Jamie Gillis is pervert. Jamie, um, Gillis would not fly. I remember it was on a TWA flight, and we're gonna take off, - and Jamie tells me that he has a tremendous fear of flying. And then he reaches down, he pulls out a baggie- - that's got panties in it and he says, this is for my black, black ore. The plane starts rolling down the runway. Jamie opens up the bag, and he starts, he starts huffing on it, the bag, - and the smell from the bag was so horrendous and so putrid, it was insane. I mean, that was Jamie. He was a pervert, - so sniffing the panties, that was like crack cocaine to him. \"Dracula Sucks,\" that was the role he was meant to play. The blood is the life- - there are far worse things awaiting man than death. In my heyday, I was maybe working maybe one or two days a week. The rest of the time, I was just hanging out, - you know, and I was making enough money- - and I wasn't even, what was that? You call that work? You know, a garbage man, that's work. And to have a career that lasts that long, - to be so innovative, and to really express- - who you truly are as a sexual being to me is something to be envied. Annette definitely looked like she would be in the mainstream movies. She definitely did not look like she was in the adult industry. She could've been a Victoria secret model. She was just so fetching and a wonderful actress- - and serious as a heart attack and a great businesswoman. The most amazing thing for me about Annette haven- - is, um, not just like how beautiful she is, but also how kind of innocent she is. She combined like this very ethereal personality, look, and so forth with the sex. And, uh, she was one of the first where, - where her name became, you know, a name. I wasn't aware of how popular I was. I have never been aware of that. I've never been aware of how beautiful I am. I remember being in la. In the summer of '77, and \"desires within young girls\"- - making more money at the box office than over half of Hollywood. I was in slot 14. Mel Brooks' \"Young Frankenstein\" was in slot 17. Annette, uh, was always perceived as a feminist, and she still is. As far as I know, I am the only person in adult films- - who did not do any of the degrading acts. The facial ejaculation, because I don't want- - that represented to the American public as adult sexuality. You know what's interesting about Annette is that- - you would almost kind of not expect her- - to be a very good actress just based off of the fact- - that she didn't have an acting background. But she is so good. You said you'd give me a chance. Aren't you forgetting something? \"Sports Life\" is a man's magazine. But that's just it, you see, - we get all the women's readership, too. Finding people who could speak, - who were beautiful, who had beautiful bodies, - blah, blah, blah, it was a bit difficult, I guess. Blake Edwards approached me for \"10.\" Blake was very nice, and invited me down to Hollywood. He said, can you get me people who are naked? And I said, oh, yeah. So I was the casting agent, and the production manager for the party scene. There was something, uh, just wonderful to watch- - Annette Haven on film having sex. We all have to pretend, what, our mommies didn't have sex. Every last one of our mommies had sex. Hopefully they enjoyed it. I want you to let me see your tits. How and when did I meet Richard Pacheco? I think it was some point in the early '80$. When he said that he was writing a book, he said, will you write the forward? And I said I would. He is family. He's a nice Jewish boy. You could take him home to mom I think. I had plans of becoming a rabbi, and they happened at the same time, - uh, I had my first offer to be in a porn film. So I had a decision to make. Richard's motivation was to be an actor, uh, much more than a, a sex performer. By far, Richard Pacheco is the greatest male actor in adult film history. Cupid, draw back your bow, and let your arrow- - go straight to my lover's heart for me. When I met him, I was kind of freaked out- - because my mom and I enjoyed \"Playgirl\" magazine, and we had his pinup. In the 1980s, if Hollywood didn't put a scarlet letter- - around the adult industry, he would have been the first actor- - to cross over and actually do adult, and then do mainstream films, - like James Deen does now. Richard Pacheco won best supporting actor, for \"nothing to hide,\" uh, - because he portrayed somebody that was, uh, slow. But he was really sweet, too, and it was a very romantic little storyline. I love her. Well, I love Miss Fernstein the landlord, too. That doesn't mean I'm gonna marry her, does it? It's not the same thing, jack, and you know it. Fuck love, man! What are you, a sucker? \"Irresistible\" was “Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure.\" They must have taken cues from that. There were so many different parallels with that. What province are you from? You probably haven't heard of it. It's called Marin county. They gave me Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor. And, wow. Wow. Thank you, Jesus. That was a coup. It's ironic that porn-stars were discredited- - because they were fucking, 'cause you can't fake fucking. You really got to be there, and that's a tremendous achievement- - to get yourself real enough to be able to do that. Do I think he would've made it as a straight actor? Probably, you know, 'cause he's really good. He knows how to improvise. He knows how to be a straight actor. He knows these things. I think that's what makes him one of the greats. Some adult stars gain even greater fame- - by crossing over into mainstream entertainment. Sometimes a scandal worked in their favor. Other times, great marketing, or an inherently irresistible appeal- - bridged the gap between sex stardom, and pop culture acclaim. These stars blasted right through barriers- - separating the adult business from big time show business. Of those big three, Linda Lovelace, Georgina Spelvin, - Marilyn Chambers, Marilyn clearly stands out. The camera loved her. But she had this girl next door like innocent look- - that not many girls in porn back then had. Well, I answered an ad in the San Francisco \"Chronicle\"- - that said, now casting for a major motion picture. I thought, oh, this is a little bit too naughty for me. She thought that if she did a good job in this movie- - it would lead to a lot of mainstream roles for her- - because it would show that she could act. But also, the amount of money they were offering was like, mm. You know, they're like we really like your look. Just sit down and talk with us. And so she actually negotiated with them, and said that she would do it, - but only under the circumstances - that they give her, um, ten percent of the film's gross revenue, - which is huge, you know, like that's insane. And I said I don't really wanna know what's gonna happen. I know it's gonna be wild and sexy, - and it's gonna be scary probably for me at certain times, but I don't wanna know. When we started to have sex, it was the kind of thing where I was like totally freaked out. I didn't think I was gonna be able to do this one. Then it, there was a moment where it turned from terror, hah, to pleasure, - and I really believe you can see that. The controversy between me being on the ivory soap box, - it was a pr man's dream. It just happened to be the very same week that \"Behind the Green Door\" opened in the theaters. So it was just, thank you. And Procter & Gamble wasn't real happy about it. My favorite scene is the pool table scene in \"Insatiable.\" I could tell that it was a hot scene- - because when the crew applauds you, you know that it's good. \"Insatiable\" was one of those quintessential movies. Rich girl who is a model, and she just had this sexual appetite- - that nobody could satisfy. I devote myself to all men, and a lot of women. She wrote a song for it, - for the movie she did, \"Insatiable,\" and she actually sang it. It's the song that plays behind the titles. She did some modeling beyond that. She even did dinner theater in Las Vegas, for about a year. Believe it or not, the mayor of Las Vegas gave her the key to the city. I don't know what it used to be like to hire an adult actor in a mainstream type movie. I don't know if that was a big stigma that people had to get over. I assume it must have been. The biggest one I remember is when Marilyn Chambers was in Cronenberg's film. And he cast her as the lead in his movie \"Rabid.\" You gotta come quick. You gotta come quick and get me. And of course that had never happened before. This was the first time someone who had been a porn-star, - who was well known as a porn-star was cast in a major mainstream movie. Being Marilyn Chambers has always been kind of, - not a facade, because I've always believed that you have to be that person 24 hours a day. You have to really believe in what you're doing, which I have, and I've had a lot of fun. But now that I have a daughter. Learning all of that was kind of scary at first, because like I said, - my mom is my mom, not Marilyn chambers to me. So knowing everything that she's done- - and my friends knowing the things that she's done, - um, is was pretty hard to get used to. But there were some funny times where I'd see her name on HBO- - and she'd come running out and say like, close your eyes. Don't watch that. I just don't want her to follow in my footsteps. In the end like I'm just so proud of her, and she knew that, so that was my only concern. I'm not gonna say that I created porno chic, but I know that I was part of it. And that was a very important time in our history- - where people like Johnny Carson were waiting in line- - to see “Deep Throat\" and \"Behind the Green Door.\" And I truly believe that it's not educational, - but it certainly can be very helpful in kind of helping your sex life. It helped mine. He's not, you know, sort of like the hulking male porn-star. Of the '90s with like the, you know, like thong tan lines and stuff like huge pecs. And he's just this guy, the kind of guy that you would have a crush on in chemistry class. That's him. He's the Justin Bieber of porn. So my whole life is I wanna do porn, I wanna do porn, I wanna do porn. It wasn't a new thing when I turned 18 to, you know, tell my parents. So once I explained all this to my parents, - and then also reminded them that I still have my money- - from when I got bar mitzvahed. Like I, I'm not the type of guy who's gonna think, oh, I made a bunch of money. I'm gonna go buy a Ferrari and a solid gold house, and like get a rocket car. That's also a \"Simpson's\" reference. I met James when he was, I believe he was 18 years old. I mean, he was just good. I mean, we went through the entire scene, - and then he popped, and I was like, oh, shit. We've got to go through and do the stills. And he was like: \"That's cool. I'm young and spry. I can get some more out.\" So... and he did, which was outstanding. In 2009, I became the youngest person to ever win male performer of the year- - from AVN, which is a very prestigious award. All: James Deen. I had a panic attack, ran and hid, and my girlfriend at the time accepted the award for me. James, where the fuck are you? I have heard of the Deen-agers. Deen-agers is invented by Dana Dearmond. She was the one who coined that term, so let's give credit where credit is due. Because he's such a relatable guy, - and he's young enough for, you know, young girls to be attracted to him. What's funny to be me is there are scenes that I've done with him- - and I'll get tagged because he's in the scene, and the Deen-agers love James Deen, - and I just happened to be an extra body in the room. I feel like people are trying to create more of that \"Boy and Girl Next Door\" look. But when I first started in 2004, it was all about performance. It had nothing to do with guys or props. We don't care what you look like, you know. Like why the hell, who's looking at you? I have no desire to do mainstream stuff. \"The Canyons\"? Hell, yeah. You have Bret Easton Ellis, who's an incredibly talented writer- - and you have Paul Schrader who's an incredibly talented director- - and they were like so sick of the standard Hollywood structure of, you know, - all the stuff, and they wanted to do a DIY film- - that was just for the sake of making a fucking film. - Jealous? - Yeah, - if there are other people involved. Like guys. It's mostly girls, and, no, I do not get jealous watching my girl hook up with another chick. Is this guy for real? Are you for real? Which is the most flattering thing in the world- - that the guy that wrote \"American Psycho\" and \"Less Than Zero\"- - wrote a character for me. I mean, sometimes these, these, you know, people in adult will get like this sort of taste- - of mainstream attention and decide that they're, they're gonna move on and start this whole new life. Adult films are not a launching pad into mainstream. It's just not. I think there's this stigma that people in adult films, - they do this 'cause they have to- - or they do this because they have nothing else- - or, or, and they forget that we're performers, - just like The Rock and Vin Diesel are action performers. Being famous in the adult industry is useless. Being a good performer is what matters. She was Vivid. They signed her to be the face of the company. She was on every box cover. Well, there was no such thing as a contract girl until Ginger came along. She is definitely a matriarch in the business. I think she's the beautiful girl next door. I do. I think she's that girl next door- - that you've had that crush on for a really long time- - and then all of a sudden just kind of came into her own sexually. And you definitely wanted to bang the shit out of her, and she never had time for you. I walked into, uh, Jim South's office. He was my agent. Uh, you don't have a portfolio? Oh, no. I had my shots in high school. And I tell him, okay, I'm gonna do it. And I want this much money and I want script approval- - and I want cast approval. He's on the floor rolling. He said you're not gonna start that way. Lunch is served. I got all my demands met, and I started thinking, - oh, my god. What if I can't do this? My very first film was \"Surrender in Paradise.\" I was fine fucking on film. Could not get the dialogue to come out of my mouth. We spent about four hours trying to do it. And I thought you might be different. Like all the other guys, get what you want and chuck me out. So Steven Hirsch was starting vivid entertainment, - actually at that time, it was called vivid video, - and they wanted me to be the star of all of their first films. Every day I would wake up and go, yes! I'm gonna blow this guy today. I'm gonna eat that pussy today. I'm gonna do this. And it was exciting for me. If you stuck with it, if you became a pro, - hell, I don't think there's anybody that could even come close to you. Do I look okay? You look great. \"New Wave Hookers\" was an amazing film. Stick your tongue in up my ass hole and lick it. Girls next door didn't do double penetration. I was, I was the girl next door who did all the dirty things. I've done more mainstream than I have adult at this point. I need to pee! - What about my hands? - What about 'em? - How am I gonna wipe? - I'll help ya. So I did \"Vice Academy\" one, two, and three. And each of you must make ten arrests in order to get a position on the force. My father says that my badge and uniform are already waiting for me. So I like hiring people where they already- - come with their weird baggage of their career or life. So as soon as they walk on screen, you know, be it a Ginger Lynn or a Danny Trejo, - you go, somethin's goin' on there. She showed up on crutches, which was kind of a surprise. My introduction to Sid Haig was just being plopped on on his dirty tighty whities. - Yes, yes, yes. - Come on, baby. Oh, oh, oh, ride it, baby. Ride it, ride it, ride it. She started it all. I mean, without her, there could not have been - strong names like Chasey Lain, and Jenna Jameson. She is the number one. There are very few women like her. Do it! Yeah. Uh-huh. Yeah. Oh, slam it. Slam that cunt for me. Ugh! Yeah! I felt like I could watch her, and see the emotion- - not just in her face, but in her body. Janine is super hot. Like super hot, like supermodel hot. I asked my husband if he was okay with it, and we agreed that women only. She knew how to turn it on. She'd been in front of audiences- - for a long time as a dancer. In blondage, they did their routine, it was so hot, like I was completely turned on. And then they go backstage, and then they do their real scene- - in the behind the scenes, and I was like, yeah, yeah. The drugs, the alcohol involved with porn. During that time, there was, and I would partake, and it was not a pretty sight. You will sink hard and fast if you go down that road. She is the person that made porn feel not only super mainstream, - but she was kind of like the rockstar of porn. Blink 182. That has got to be my highlight. It brought in the youth. So the Vince Neil sex tape. It was rough, because at this time, I hadn't shot anything with men. But, you know, it was a shocker at first. I find it interesting that she comes back- - as like this like beast of a sexual woman. She does dudes. She does interracial. Please? Please please me. Finally I said fuck it. I'm gonna go for it, and this is what I want. These are my fantasies. And that's when I think a lot of like the passionate scenes that I had in \"Pirates,\" you know... Um, that intensity was really starting to come out. I wouldn't change a thing. At the time, there was a lot of glamour and a lot of fun, and a lot of camaraderie. That was, that was a good time. Yes, yes, yes, yes. Oh, my god. Fuck. Yes, yes. I'd like to think I was political before, and that was- - a large part of my motivation getting into the industry- - was to disprove the status quo about women, uh, and, and, and female sexuality. The more I watched porn, the more I realized that this is something I could do- - and, and maybe I could bring something different to it as well. When Sasha Grey first contacted me, this is what she wrote me. \"I hunger for all modes of sexual perversity.\" I'm determined and ready to be a commodity that fulfills everyone's fantasies. Available for solo, stills, girl/girl, boy/girl, boy/boy/girl, - DP, double vag, interracial, throat gagging, - creampies, BDSM, fetish, facials, \"bachelor parties, and groups of no more than four.\" She's cool. Sasha is, is deep. We're remaking \"Deep Throat,\" so I want to meet her. The new \"Deep Throat\" is a huge movie. It's important. It's the biggest movie, you know, this company has ever made. It took us a long time to decide who could really pull it off, and it's Sasha. Steven Soderbergh looked her up, and found the Myspace page. Contacted her through that. I didn't want anybody other than Sasha, for \"Girlfriend Experience.\" Once I'd spoken to her, - I really felt I wanted to build it around her, - and I sort of cast everybody else based on what I was getting from her. I'm very familiar with his work, and it was flattering, to be honest, - uh, but also extremely intimidating. He's an incredibly intelligent human being. I found this, it's kind of a really interesting dichotomy with her of, of- - middle American upbringing, and sort of extreme interest and extreme behavior. Whatever method she found of reconciling these two things, - seemed to be working for her. He told me it would be mostly improv, and wanted me to be comfortable with that. So how did it go? It was fine. We had a nice dinner. You know, went back to the hotel. But he's very well-endowed, and sometimes I just can't handle him that long. The change, I think, largely via the internet about people's attitudes about pornography - or just, just sex videos in general has just completely shifted in the last ten years. Making that leap from doing hardcore porn to shooting mainstream movies - with very well known people is, is almost impossible. She was like Garbo-esque. So I said, well, if this is any time to take the jump, this is it, and I did it quietly. It wasn't this big announcement. I'm not leaving anything behind. I haven't found Jesus. I'm not trying to run away from anything. I'm just moving on. What made her a great porn-star? Besides the fact that she was really good looking, she was a pervert, - and nobody could bullshit her, because she was like usually smarter- - than most of the people shooting her. Some names are bigger than others. And the top two greatest adult stars of all time share one thing in common, - they're erotic icons. They check every box for what makes a legend. Longevity? Check. Mainstream popularity? Double check. Sexual prowess? Check. Looks? Well, women of the '70s and '80s found him very handsome, - and men still drool over her. There are no two bigger names in the history of adult cinema - than our greatest male and female adult stars of all time. ♪ You're a winner ♪“ ♪ That's what you are ♪ ♪ Believe it or not ♪ ♪ You know ♪ ♪ You're really a star ♪ ♪ And so happy... ♪ Let's talk about fame. Uh, most famous guy in porn worldwide has gotta be Ron Jeremy. Without ever having had a publicist, without every having had an agent or a manager, - has managed to become the most famous pop culture icon. I mean, he transcends porn. People don't think of Ron Jeremy as a porn-star. People think of Ron Jeremy as a famous person. I was there in the golden era, - that's what they call it, the golden era, I was there right smack in the middle of it. I was going back and forth, L.A. to New York. I heard that his dick was so big that he actually could like, you know, go on himself. Go suck yourself off, she says. Charming. I first got into porn thinking I'd just be in it- - for maybe just a couple of weeks, a few months. See what it's like and then get out. So I started doing all the bigger films in New York. \"Bad Girls\" had a cute little story where I was a boy scout. Hello. Oh, my goodness! - Please. - What do you want? I'd like some of that pussy, if you don't mind. So he's infiltrated media in like all its forms, mainstream and porn. And he's fantastic. He's a really good actor. He's like the essential ham. As an actor, when he's awake, great performance. Adam Rifkin is the nicest guy I know- - and the greatest guy I know, and I have to say this- - or he'll stop giving me parts in movies, - the guy is easy and he's been more loyal than anybody on the planet. I made this movie called \"Detroit Rock City,\" and obviously to play the emcee- - at the male strip club was an easy one. That was our viking, Patrick Hirsch, - and he's hung like a Norse. Our next amateur has a name like a bird, and if you like birds, you'll like this. It's just a swallow. I'd never heard of him before I got in the industry. I saw him on MTV, uh, when he was doing a reality tv show. And that's the impression I had of him, not as a sexpert, just him being funny. I have a feeling there're gonna be a lot of people who are dead set against- - what I do for a living, maybe religious, could be born again, you know. So I have a gut feeling that I'm gonna come across- - some adversarial opinions as to my career choices. In \"Orgazmo,\" we do a martial art fight. At the end, he gets the Orgazmo's gun on me, - and I freeze up, kicks me in the head, my head literally blows up. \"Boon Dock Saints\" is by far the biggest thing I've ever done as far as an audience. Sit the fuck down. All these stars, when they see Ron Jeremy, - they drop whatever they do, I've seen it, drop whatever they do. Oh, my god. Get a picture with Ron Jeremy. Kurt Cobain and Courtney Love- - went running over to him for an autograph when they saw him. George Bush, Sr. was walking the other way having, - he was just President of The United States, - as they're passing, he hears George bush say, hello, Ron. That's why I attribute my longevity to just a lot of hard work, - a lot of classical movies from the golden era, - and also a lot of mainstream. It's amazing for all the things- - that Ron Jeremy has seen and done in his life, - how he manages to maintain a sense of innocence. And I swear to you, he is a, he's like an innocent kid- - in the body of this... Hideous monster. Listen, I'm gonna say goodbye now while I kiss these nipples. Look how and they're cold, they stick out even more. Why is Jenna so popular? She was maybe not even arguably- - the most successful, the most well marketed, - the best selling porn-star of all time. Jenna might've had a little bit of that Ginger Lynn thing- - where she just looked so young and sweet and innocent- - and looked like the last place she should be- - was looking to get into this business. And I thought I could do it better, you know. I just always felt that way all my life, that I was capable of topping everyone. That's the shot you'd see in your magazine, folks, right there. Yeah. Yeah. I read Jenna Jameson's book \"How to make love like a porn-star,\" - and I, I was so attracted to the industry from those pages. Jenna and I shot our first movie on the same day. - I'm Kylie. - And I'm Jenna. I'm 19. 'Cause, I mean, here's little Jenna, and she's a little blonde, perfect little tiny boobs, - and she was asking me about mine. She's like, where'd you get yours? They're great. What doctor did them? I'm like don't touch those. Those are perfect. Look, back in '95, - while the business was starting to go through a growth, - it was still only two years into Wicked Pictures. I just said, listen, you can either jump on the Jenna train- - or I'm out, and this is what I want. Give it to me and I will skyrocket. We signed Jenna, - and it didn't take very long for Jenna to become the big deal. Even then, you knew that Jenna was gonna be something big. She'd already started to climb that ladder, - and she was already Jenna vs. Jenna Jameson. I just had larger than life ideas. Jenna was winning Best Actress, Best Sex Scene, Starlet of the Year. One of her movies we did won Best Film. So it was really a quick ride. I was starting to gain momentum. I knew I was capable of so much more. She was everywhere. Again, she was not just on the porn sets. She was in movies. You have to be a stripper with a take no prisoners raw survival instinct. She was on talk shows. I can't believe it. I'm looking at your pictures. You could be a model. Thank you. By this time, she already knew what was going on. She knew how to light things and she knew how to direct- - and she knew the kind of scenes that she wanted to do. She owned all that. This ls a male dominated industry, and I can crack it open. I started my own company, club Jenna. I think Jenna Jameson was super business savvy, - and she, you know, had a whole idea of how her career was gonna go- - and exactly the moves she was going to make in order for her to have longevity in adult- - and also to make tons and tons of money at a time in the business, when, you know, it was opportune. I shot my own movies for my company, - and I also did a licensing! Distribution deal with Vivid, - which was ground breaking, like changed things for the whole industry when they saw those numbers. Then I got to direct her in, in uh, \"The Masseuse,\" of course, - and \"Devil in Miss Jones,\" - and two of the best movies I've ever done. Well, things are about to change. You can have anything you want. Oh... She became somewhat of a control freak. I felt myself like ramping up. I was like, okay, I'm starting to get this. She got so much adulation so quickly. I couldn't go anywhere without people screaming my name. And she didn't handle it as well as she might have. It was, it kind of blew my mind. I saw her become a caricature of herself. It was like being Julia Roberts when she got her Oscar, you know. She seemed to start to become less happy. I played the part. I worked it. I brought glamour. I never did anything half-ass. I think it was the right girl, the right time, - the right company, and all things were aligned, and it worked. Do I think it's possible to do that again on that level? I don't. I think she is probably the biggest star of all time- - because I don't think that can happen again. It's fair to say this list is far from complete. Dozens of other larger than life legends- - deserve to have their stories told, - performers who've contributed to the adult industry- - in unique and important ways, many of whom continue to. But when it comes to the modern porn industry, - which began in actual movie theaters five decades ago- - and continues on hand-held devices today, - these are the stars who have shined the brightest, and rocked us the hardest. I'm Mr. Skin. Good night. Woman excellent. I'm the best clapper ever. Nice. I have spent quite a bit of time with ginger. She will never cease to chase me around- - with a dildo or a strap-on or taking off my clothes, - and that's, that's ginger. I hated those scarves. The scarves were provided. There's enough cum on those scarves to start a whole new population of people. Something that I've never revealed about myself. I have a big giant penis. It's just, it's tucked inside my vagina. That's what I was gonna tell you. Is it good? Come on. I mean, you know, DP? That's kind of a natural thing. If there's another guy in the picture, you know, you got the extra hole. And she was a wild girl. Cubans are wild. Don't you know Cubans? They got that nice round ass and they're wild, man. My famous line was, you know, You wanna twat sandwich, baby? Where she had the biggest clit and the largest pussy lips- - at that particular time, which, I'm a freak, and so that immediately- - got me fanatically involved with like sucking and swallowing them down. I had a pimp, which he got paid 40%. I took 60 'cause I had to get a boyfriend out of jail. So I'm used to those days. Hippie girls, hair under their arms, - all that kind of stuff. Hair all over their legs. You couldn't see the pussy. It was all like a tree. You had to like take a rake and like rake it out to get even to see anything. And each scene was connected, not separate scenes. Everything flowed like a river or something. - And a lot of pubic hairs. - They were all so hairy. Pubic hair. There was a lot of hair. And she had pubic hair. And lots of it. I was just gonna say that. The first time I had a strange dick in my hairy pussy. It was the '80s. I'd probably been in the business a few months. I still was a little nervous about the business, - and now they have me driving out to the hinterlands, for this shoot, and I'm sure - that I'm gonna get killed out there, and buried in an avocado grove. Whoa. Sorry. That was so compelling, you lost your balance. I was impressed by both the ladies in that scene, actually. I saw that about to happen. There's a whole bunch of producers I had to sleep with to get a lot of jobs. No, I'm just... - I hope not. - Slept with two of 'em at least. And one that took you to a Barry Manilow concert. She called me up... Dude, but they made me stars, though. I slept with the right producers, I swear. Which ones off the record? I guess \"Deep Throat\" was such a big event. People were going to see \"Deep Throat.\" It wasn't a very good movie, but people wanted to see it. I guess part of it was Linda had, you know, had kind of a sweet look to her. She was a filthy little whore, but she had a sweet look to her. I really just love the whole idea that she has with the whole thing. I just went blah, blah, blah in my head. And I'm like blah, blah, blah. My first blow-job, and I'm looking everybody in the eye, - 'cause there's like 30 people on the set. Welcome to my blow-job. Welcome to my blow-job. Is this cool? I did ten films with Veronica Hart. And then we were talking about our parents, - and my father worked out at the test site out in Nevada. What a nice thing, your father makes bombs. How nice. I came down hard on her. I said your father's a murderer. All of a sudden, R. Bolla was saying- - that my dad was the cause of everything wrong in the world. I saw that she was hurt, so I told her I was sorry. I really did. I said I'm really sorry that I hate your father. No. Well done. I know who I fucked and when I fucked 'em. No, I burped. I burped. Here's a little tidbit about Ron. And Ron is desperate to be in mainstream movies. And I think to his detriment he has become, through his own doing, - too famous to be taken seriously as an actor the way he would like to be. So you just see Ron Jeremy you go, oh, it's Ron Jeremy. You don't see Ron Jeremy playing like the office guy- - or Ron Jeremy playing the attorney. It's like Ron Jeremy playing the attorney. The only way to actually to be the king of porn is like to, uh, kill Ron Jeremy. Just smack it. Excellent. Actually, I would like to do that again. Let's slate again please.", "url": "https://subslikescript.com/movie/X-Rated_2_The_Greatest_Adult_Stars_of_All_Time-6189052"},

Mrs. Li… Xihe’s been acting up  in class recently. He ran around in class sometimes. Some teachers have complained to me about this. Is that so… I’m really sorry for the trouble. I’m his mother… I know what he’s like. The thing is… some parents have complained  to the principal. What? What did the principal say? Given the situation… the school decided to observe him  some more. Ms. Zhao, you know  how hard it was to get Xihe in. Please don’t kick him out.  I’m begging you. Mrs. Li, I understand you completely. We agreed to admit Xihe because we truly care about him. But now there are some problems. Let’s work together to solve them. Okay. Okay. Thank you.

I’m really sorry! You knew what your son is like. You shouldn’t have sent him to school! It was an accident, really. Xihe is usually well-behaved. Well-behaved? Like when he poked his classmate  with a pencil? Or when he peed in the hallway? Or screamed and shouted in  the middle of a class? Mrs., my son is slightly autistic. Sometimes he can’t control  his emotions. So what? Is that an excuse for his misbehavior? With his conditions… you shouldn’t have sent him here  in the first place! Xihe, come here! Say sorry to Dingding. Say you’re sorry! Say it! Say it! Say it! Mr. Principal… Why do you admit kids  with mental problems here? Dingding, let’s go! Mrs. ... Mrs.Wu! Now, take him back home to rest. We’ll talk about this later. Okay. Please, don’t kick him out.  I’m begging you. It took us much to send you  to study here. Now with the bite,  they’ll probably kick you out. You know that? Xihe… Remember. No biting at school. No biting and you can go to school! Let’s go. Subway! Subway! -Let’s go.  -Take the subway! This entrance’s closed.  Let’s go to the other side. Xihe! Let’s go! -Are you going or not? -Take the subway. Let go of the railing! Let’s go! Xihe, be quiet. -Stop it!  -Take the subway. Next time when he’s about  to have a fit… Try to distract him immediately. That seems to work. Zixiang's grandma. I’ve heard that you enjoy  good relations with the school. Hmm, the principal  was my husband’s student. Could you put in a good word  for my son? I’m sorry. It’s hard enough with Zixiang. Today I saw some pupils  bullying Zixiang. Do you know about this? I do. Those bruises on his face  are clear enough. It’s normal for him. He’s in puberty now. I see. Xihe is lucky to be raised  by his parents. Poor Zixiang has nobody but me,  his old grandma. The next station is Houhai. The door on the left side  will be used. Please mind the gap between  the train and the platform. If it were up to me, I’d have him go to  a special education school. It would be easier. No way. We took so much trouble  to get him in. I know you put a lot of effort. But he’s all alone in school… I’ll accompany him  studying there if it helps! What? Are you serious? You went to the kindergarten with him. Now again? So? We’ve made it, haven’t we? But we made it with a cost. You left a splendid job  three years ago. I’m talking about Xihe with you. Nothing to do with my job. Tell me, what should we do with him? That’s easy. Let’s have another child. We’ve talked about this! I only… The food! It’s burnt. -Wait, wait.  -Don’t move. -Wait.  -What are you doing? Dear, not with that, okay? I’ve checked up on autism. It’s not hereditary. What are you talking about? Besides, if we have  another healthy child… he can take care of Xihe, right? I… How dare you say that? Wait. Honey. My name is Li Xihe. Xihe is going to school. Xihe, there’s no school today. Come, give me your schoolbag. Take off the pass. Here, read something. Zixiang, time for breakfast. Come. Hurry. Soy milk? I’ll go and get you some. I’m late! Xihe, breakfast! Xihe! Xihe! Sorry! Excuse me! Please wait in line and mind the gap  between the train and the platform. We’re arriving at Keyuan Station. Xihe! Xihe! Xihe! -Xihe’s going to school. -Xihe! Xihe! Why did you leave home alone? Huh? I was worried sick about you! What if you get lost? You scared me.. I’m spanking you! -Will you do that again? Will you? -Don’t beat him. Don’t beat him. Calm down. -Calm down. Calm. -Don’t you dare leave home alone! Listen to your mum.  Don’t beat him. Calm down… Xihe’s going to school. Today Mum will be your teacher. Here, take this. Have you learned this? What‘s this? An elephant. Yes. An elephant. What color is an elephant? What color is an elephant? It’s grey. -Grey.  -Grey. Good. Okay. Let’s see the next one. Here. What’s this? Clear sky and white clouds  follow the rain. Clear sky and white clouds  follow the rain. A rainbow spans the sky like a bridge. A rainbow spans the sky like a bridge. Very good. Who would like to try  and read it out loud? You will get a gold star. Hello, Ms. Zhao. Hi, Mrs. Li. I brought Xihe to class. Don’t worry about us. We won’t disturb the class.  I’ll stay with him. I’ll stay with him. But there’s no desk and chair for him. That’s okay.  We can stand here listening. Wait a second. I have a chair for you. But I'm sorry  I can't get a desk for you. Thank you, Ms. Zhao. Xihe, time for class. Okay, class.  Let’s read it one more time. Clear sky and white clouds follow the rain. Clear sky and white clouds follow the rain. A rainbow spans the sky like a bridge. A rainbow spans the sky like a bridge. Red, orange, yellow, green,  blue, indigo and violet. Red, orange, yellow, green,  blue, indigo and violet. The palette of colors  is admired by all. The palette of colors  is admired by all. Hi, Principal He. Come in. Come. Xihe. Mr. Principal, I’m sorry. I won’t…won’t… I won’t make… I won’t make trouble again. I promise to follow the rules. Get along well with my classmates. And study hard. That’s great. So please he deserves  one more chance. Please. But we’ve had  so many problems already. I cannot afford to have any incident. He’s only slightly autistic,  but it’s not serious. It’s not up to us  to decide how serious it is. I suggest that you send him  to a special education school. He’ll be better off  in a new environment. Now I have a meeting to go. Please excuse me. Xihe’s going to school. Go to class. Let’s go. Xihe! Come back! Didn’t the school ask you to leave? He has the right to go to school. Your son should go  to a special education school. Where he should go  is not your business. Don’t you know  what’s wrong with your son? He poked my son’s hand with a pencil. And the principal  didn’t do anything about it. He’s shielding you. Your son makes noises in class  and ignores disciplines... He’s a bad influence  on all of our children, right? -Right! -That’s right! We won’t leave this school. My son has the right to go to school. But you can’t just  think about yourself! Exactly! This should have been  your own problem. Now it becomes a burden to us all. You’re too selfish. I am his mother. I’ll do what’s best for him! You are very unreasonable. Unreasonable? My son has the legal right to attend school. And none of you can take that away! Okay. Know what,  let’s go to see the principal! -Let’s go. -Let go of me! -Go to see the principal! -What are you doing? -Let’s go. -Let me go! -Go. -Let’s go see the principal. Let me go! Let me go! -Get off me! -Let’s go see the principal. Fine! You come with me. Let’s go. Don’t touch my son! How dare you… Hey! Hey! Stop it! -What happened? -Are you okay? She bit me! -She bit you!  -She bites! Her son bites people. And she’s no better! It’s in their blood! Here, eat this. And for you, dear. Honey. Dear, please open up. Honey! Mr. Zhu, I… Xihe’s not doing very well. Hmm, okay. Thanks, Mr. Zhu. Xihe! Xihe’s going to school! No school today! Hi, Ms. Zhao. Hi, Mrs. Li. Many parents are concerned about  what happened yesterday. I can explain it. After careful consideration, we’ve decided that... given Xihe’s condition  it’s best for him to leave. I’m so sorry about this. Mr. Principal… Couldn’t we reconsider this? What’s there to be reconsidered? We shouldn’t have admitted him in the first place. I’d like to give it a try. Hey! Hey! School. Stop. I’m dropping my son off. Parents aren’t allowed to enter  for no reason. Please let us come in. It’s urgent. Sorry, I can’t help you. Xihe’s going to school. I’m here to see the principal. You’re not allowed inside. It’s the rule! But I’m here to see the principal! -Please, let me in! -Don’t make this hard for me. I won’t. Why can’t you just let me in? Close the gate! What are you doing? I’m begging you. Please let me in! Parents aren’t allowed to go inside! Xihe! Look. It’s Dingding. Hey, Dingding! Lei Yiming! Come in. Class is about to start. Come in. Come in. Hurry up. -Come in. -Come in and play with us. Hi, Mrs. Li. Hi, Ms. Zhao. What you’re doing is useless. Even if the school admits him again, we’ll have those parents to deal with. They’re the crux of the matter. Do you understand? I understand. Thank you. Okay. I need to get back to work. Come in, Xihe. -Class is going to start.  -We’re going to class. Now, now, we all know about it. Stop crying. You bad boy! -No, don’t beat him!  -Don’t beat him. -Bad boy! -Don’t beat him! -Bad boy! Bad boy! -Stop it! Calm down! Don’t beat him! We’re sorry. What am I supposed to tell the girl’s parents? Ma’am, please vote for me  to go to school. Ma’am, please vote for me  to go to school. Mister, please vote for me  to go to school. Mister, please vote for me to go to school. Granddad, please vote for me  to go to school. Say it! Granddad,  please vote for me to go to school. Come on, say it! Granddad, please vote for me to go to school. Stop it! You are so annoying! I didn’t mean you. Come on, say it. Dear, I think… You don’t need to  get so worked up over this. Hopefully it’ll work out. If not, Xihe can always  go to a special education school. No way! Xihe is different from them. You insist on forcing him there. He just can’t fit in. Nonsense! If he doesn’t go to  a normal school now, how’s he supposed to fit in  with others in the society? I think… as long as Xihe’s happy,  nothing else matters. He’s happy with this school. But this school isn’t happy with him. If you don’t support us,  just get lost! But… I’m doing a pretty good job here. Dear… We’re off. Wait, wait. Let me give you a ride. No. We’ll be fine. Work hard and earn more money. -Will do.  -Go. Take care! Hello? Move the air conditioner? Sure can do. From where to where? Okay. Okay. I’ll be there in 20 minutes. Okay. See you later. I’m not worried about  him biting other children. I’m worried about him  interfering with my child’s study. Don’t worry.  I’ll attend class with him. I’ll see to it that he doesn’t  interfere anyone else. But he has already  had many times at that. I promise it absolutely  won’t happen again! I don’t doubt your resolution. He didn’t do it on purpose. But he can’t control himself. Am I right? I’m sorry. So, how do they feel? Fine, a bit tight maybe. I’ll go and find you another pair. I don’t need your help. What would you do if you were me? Let’s go. How are those bigger ones feel? What would you do if your child was autistic? You are so mean! I know about autism. I’ll vote for him. In this way my child can also learn  how to help others. That’s very kind of you. Then would you mind  signing this petition? Okay. Thank you so much. Mrs. Lei! Please sign this for Xihe! -Please! I thank you. -Excuse me. Please! Mrs. Lei! He needs your help! Please! Mrs. Lei! Please help us! Get in the car. -Please sign it. Please! -Leave us alone, okay? This is the petition for Xihe  to go back to school. I’m begging you, please. Please, please sign it. Go and ask someone else! Please sign your name on it. Could you please just sign it? -I’m begging you.  -I’m busy. Find someone else. -You finished? -Yes, sir. All done. -I’ll pay you for your work. -Okay. Here. Sir, this isn’t right. Could you give me some more? We agreed on 500 yuan. Yes… But that was for 3 units.  I installed 4. So I gave you 100 more. No… Sir, please. Give me a bit more. 50 yuan, okay? My son’s waiting for me. Just 50 yuan, please. That’s all I’m asking for. There, catch it. Daddy, catch. Again. Xihe! This is it. Dingding! Dingding! Hi, Xihe! Hello, auntie! Dingding, we came to see you. I brought you plenty of goodies. Here. What are you doing here? Hi, ma’am. I came to apologize to you. I bought something for you.  Please accept it. No, thanks. -Please accept it. -I don’t want it. Please! Please accept it. Accept it, please. Dingding, back to the piano. Say it. Ma’am, please vote for me to go to school. Ma’am, sorry about the other day.  I’m sorry. Ma’am, please. Put it down. Honey! Here, give it to me. You hungry, son? I just don’t see  why you bother to do this! Dear… Is it really worth it? It is! And… Take a look at this. It was written by a foreign mother  with an autistic child. Her child’s condition  is much worse than Xihe’s. And thanks to attending a normal school, the child is now working at a library. But we are in China. Stop talking if you can’t be helpful. I want Xihe to blend into the society. So he can lead a normal life. A foreign mother made it. Why can’t I make it ? Yes. She made it. And she wrote a book. But you can count the books of this kind on the fingers of one hand. Hello, sir. -You’re hardworking. -It’s nothing. Right. Could you please sign this  for me? To help my boy get back to school. Eh… This. Sorry, I’m busy. -Please help us!  -I’m too busy. -Sir, please.  -Leave me alone. Why can’t I go to school? Eat more meat. How’s the result? Same as before. It is not! It’s two points higher, isn’t it? All right. All right. Two points higher.  Of course you’re right. Hey, Xihe. Get down. That’s dangerous. Let’s go. Doctor Wang? Look at his result. His score is 67 now. That’s pretty good. Actually… There’s nothing scary about  child’s autism. The thing is… As parents, we have  to be open-minded about it. In this way, the whole society  can better understand autism. -Am I right?  -Yes. I support your effort. Thank you so much. Xihe! Xihe, come over here. Here. Say thank you to Doctor Wang. Study hard, will you? We asked you to come here today… Mrs. Li, after much deliberation, we came up with  3 options for you to consider. First, send your son  to a special education school. Second, our teachers volunteer to provide... private tutor to your son  at home on weekends. Third, I think… I’m sorry. But I can’t accept  any of these options. We still hope you can  have my boy back here. His IQ is over 65. He’s only slightly autistic. He’s capable of attending class. Look, his IQ is 67 already. You see, the school has  never rejected Xihe. But there’s still the attitude of  other parents to consider. I know, many a parent  doesn’t want Xihe here. But there’re also some  who want to help. Look, these are the signatures of those who support us. Please take a look. You’ve made this  really difficult for us. We’ve already given him many chances.  Had he… I’ll sit next to him in class… For as long as it takes. Mr. Principal… I say we give Xihe another chance. Please! -Hello? -Zixiang’s grandma? Hi, Mrs. Li. Xihe’s allowed to go back to school! That’s great! Congratulations! What about Zixiang? He’s… not going back. Grandma, come and wash me! Do it yourself. Let’s talk another time. Okay. Bye. Honey? Let’s go and watch a movie? Eh… Can we? With the big flashing screen,  he’ll be restless. Don’t worry about him. You go to watch it. Xihe and I will walk around outside. And we’ll come back and  meet you when it’s over. Just forget it. We seldom hang out together. I want to stay with you. Okay. Xihe. See the Smurf. And a puppet. It’s loud, isn’t it? It’s not. It looks great on you. -Hon.  -What? Don’t move. You’ve got grey hair! No, it’s the light. No, it’s not. Don’t move. See! That’s nothing new. No big deal. -Hon.  -Eh? For years I’ve been so focused  on Xihe… I’m sorry. We’re family. I know you’ve been  through a lot these years. Xihe, let’s go. Xihe, is it beautiful? Beautiful, right? Fireworks. Fireworks. Fireworks. Dear, many geniuses around the world  are autistic, you know? Of course I do. Let’s name them. Edison, right? Yes. And Albert Einstein. -And Chen Jingrun, I think? -Yes. Let’s go to school. Xihe. Good boy! Excuse me... What are you doing? There’re many schools in this city. Please send your son to another one. Please! Please! Leave our children alone! I’m begging you. Let go of me. -Please!  -Let go! Ms. Wu, please get up. What’s this all about? This is way too much. The children need to start class now! Please, let us discuss this later. Now let the children have class. That’s right. Mrs. Li. I’m sorry. You see… All the children are  waiting for the class. Maybe… You should go home. We’re leaving. How can you be so mean  to an autistic child? All he needs is one desk! Let’s go. Go to hell! Let’s go! -Stop! Stop running! -Stop! Stop running! Come back! -Stop! -Stop! -Get down!  -Get down from there! Stop! -Don’t move! -Stop there! -Stop! -Stop! Stop right there! Stay down! Stop! Where are you going to go now? Don’t you move! Zixiang! -Got you! -Zixiang! What are you doing? He’s just a child! -What’s wrong with the boy!? -He’s a pervert! He just touched me! I’m sorry. Sorry. -Don’t let him outside. -Go and teach him a lesson! Next time I’ll call the police! Grandma! Grandma! Wash me! Wash me. Mum! Coming! Lin, you are back! Mum, are you feeling better? Much better. Xihe, say hi to grandma. Grandma. Grandma missed you. Mum, have they found my brother? Someone spotted him. And the village head  is out looking for him. I see. Xihe! -Sit down. -Okay. Xihe! Leave here! Hurry! Go on! Move! Walk! Move! Keep walking! Easy. -Take it easy! -Easy? It was hard enough catching him. What if he runs away again? Lock him up! Gui, don’t be afraid! Mum’s here. Shackle him! Quick! Hurry! The Shackle! His ankle… Cage him. Untie him first. Sir. -Weld it fast. -Okay. No, sir. No. Please don’t do that! He cannot run away again! Weld it fast! Sir, show some mercy, please. At least let him see some sunshine. That’s not my decision. The whole village  wants him to be locked up. Here, sir. Sorry for all the trouble. Please accept this. Drinks are on me. Please take it. Look! He bit me when we caught him today. I’m so sorry for your trouble! -Mrs. Tian. -Yes? For the sake of your son-in-law, I’ll give him a last chance. We’ll leave the welder here. If he ever bites people again… we’ll weld the cage. No one can save him then. -Let’s go. -Yes, sir. Mum, take good care of yourself. My brother needs you. I’m old. And I’m getting older and weaker. I can’t take care of him. Find someone to look after him. I’ll pay. But I don’t trust anyone else. Mum… Send him to a mental hospital. I couldn’t do that. Don’t mention it again. Could you take him with you? Take him with me? Then who’s going to take care of Xihe? Isn’t he going to school? The thing is… -He’s kicked out of school again.  -What? No school would like to admit him now. I don’t know what to do with him. What will you do  with your brother when I died? At least… he won’t starve if he’s with you. But I can’t. I’m already exhausted caring for Xihe. So you’ll just watch your brother die  without doing anything? Don’t be so cruel. Mum, you think I’m cruel? You only gave birth to me... so that I could  take care of my brother. Have you ever thought if I liked? Is this fair to me? I’m sorry to you. You think it’s not fair for you. But your life is still  much better than his. That’s the result of my own hard work. If I hadn’t left, I’d be just like that  lock on the cage. He’s still your brother  no matter what. Then what am I to him? A servant! That was the reason  why I was born into the world. I’d be his servant my whole life…  Is that what you want? If it were up to me, I’d rather not be born. What can we do then? It’s our destiny. And you have to accept that. I will not! I will change my destiny! This is your uncle. Lin! Go! Go! Dear… About having another child… I won’t mention it again. I have you and Xihe. You are all I want. Good morning! Morning, Ms. Tian! Today we are learning math. Please turn to page 82  of your textbook. The train bound for Station Xinxiu  is arriving. Let’s look at the butterfly problem. Xihe, count how many butterflies there are on the left side. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. Correct. There are 8. What about the right? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Right. How much is 8 plus 7? 15. We have 8 butterflies on the left  and 7 on the right. How many butterflies in total? The door is about to close, Please steer clear of the door. The train bound for Chiwan is arriving. Please steer clear of the moving door. Thank you for joining us. I’m reporting live  from a subway station. Recently, a photo of a mother  teaching her son in a subway station… has gone viral over the internet. Are you the boy’s mother? Why won’t you answer the question? Why are you doing this? What’s your purpose? How long have you been  teaching him here? Have you thought about  how this would affect the boy? Do you think this will benefit him? Are you really his mother? Of course I’m his mother! -Is this a mere stunt? -What? Is this a mere stunt? Why are you having class  in a subway station? These photos have gone  viral over the internet. The issue of  the autistic boy’s schooling… has inspired a great deal of  attention and debate. A group of volunteers  called a meeting… inviting representatives  from parties concerned. Hopefully they would arrive  at a proper solution. To have Li Xihe to study together  with other students, our school is  under tremendous pressure. With coverage of the issue, there’s mounting pressure  on all the teachers. Who should bear the responsibility? The government surely  will do everything we can to help those children  who are suffering from autism. We’re about to build  one more special education school. As for attending class  at normal schools, only a fraction of parents  place such demands. So we should… focus on the rights and  benefits of the majority. As the Ministry of Education you should take a proactive approach. Or the issue of inclusive education … we’re discussing today  will only be lip service… Empty and hollow. When we have to make a choice between the individual and the community, we have to side with the community. What we are able to do… is to send Xihe  to a special education school. But… His mother refused. We cannot depend all on  special education schools. They cannot accommodate so many needs. A society can only  be called civilized… when the rights of its disadvantaged are respected and guaranteed. But… The rights of other parents also merit our consideration, right? Many of them know nothing  about autism. Xihe is an autistic boy. This is the reality and  I can’t change it. What I can change is myself… and the society he lives in. Xihe needs to blend into the society. But I can’t make it only with  my own effort. I alone cannot surmount  such an immense obstacle. And now… I have no dream... for the rest of my life but this one… That is… I hope that normal people  in our society… can accept my boy as he is. I have this dream. Xihe lives a normal life in our world. Walking down the street, he might behave oddly. But please don’t look down upon him. All he needs is a friendly smile. That would be enough. There they are. Hello, Ms. Tian. How are things going for you and your son? -Are you still teaching him... -No photos. at the subway station? Please leave us alone. Please. Thank you all. Please leave us alone. -Could you take our questions?  -Just say a few words. No. No. I have nothing to say. And please stay away. -You’re intruding on our life. -Please talk to us. We’re now reporting live  from where Xihe lives. Please stay tuned. Keep filming. Again Ms. Tian refused  our interview request. This is the 24-hour program of Xili cable station. We’ll be staying and waiting  for our next meeting with Ms. Tian. You’ve decided? I have. At this point in time, my son needs my constant attention. I have no other choice. I thought the media coverage is doing you good, isn’t it? Mr. President, I am very grateful for what you did. But please don’t involve  the media again. If things continue like this, I’m afraid no school  would ever accept my son. So you’ve made up your mind? Yes, I have. Xihe. Mr. President, thank you. Let’s go. Dear uncles and aunties,  grandmas and grandpas. Hello. My name is Li Xihe. I’m suffering from mild autism. I have trouble communicating  with others. I want to attend a normal school. I can learn how to interact  with others there. My IQ is 67. I can learn just like anyone else. I made troubles before. And I am sorry for what I did. Please accept my sincere apology. I promise I won’t  make any troubles again. I’ll try to be friends with your child. Please help me get back to school. Your support will change my life.", "url": "https://subslikescript.com/movie/Xi_He-4253132"},

AND SINCE THE EARLIEST DAYS OF CINEMA, ADULT FILMS HAVE BEEN A PART OF THE MOTION PICTURE LANDSCAPE, MAKING US GASP FOR ENTIRELY DIFFERENT REASONS. AS FAR BACK AS THE 1880's, FILMMAKERS SAW THE GOLDMINE POTENTIAL OF EROTIC FILM-- LOOPS, STAG FILMS, PEEP SHOW BOOTHS. FOR THE NEXT 90 YEARS, SOCIETY WATCHED SEX IN A VARIETY OF WAYS. THEN IN THE 1970's, EVERYTHING CHANGED. TAKING ADVANTAGE OF A MORE SOCIALLY PERMISSIVE ATMOSPHERE, DIRECTORS BEGAN TELLING STORIES SURROUNDING THE HARDCORE SEX. FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER, FULL-LENGTH MOVIES WITH EXPLICIT SEX WERE BEING SHOWN IN THEATERS FOR A MASS AUDIENCE. IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO OVERSTATE THE IMPORTANCE OF GERARD DAMIANO'S FILM, \"DEEP THROAT.\" THIS MOVIE OPENED THE DOOR FOR VIRTUALLY EVERY ADULT FEATURE THAT CAME AFTER. WHILE THE EXAGGERATED CLOSE-UPS, CAMPY PERFORMANCES, AND FIREWORKS GOING OFF DURING ORGASMS MIGHT SEEM A LITTLE COMICAL TO A MODERN AUDIENCE, IN 1972, AUDIENCES HAD NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT.

BECAUSE YOU REALLY HAVE TO CONVEY YOUR FEELINGS, WHATEVER THEY MAY BE, THROUGH YOUR EYES AND YOUR ACTIONS. AND I SAID, \"I DON'T REALLY WANNA KNOW WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN. I KNOW IT'S GONNA BE WILD AND SEXY, AND IT'S GONNA BE SCARY, PROBABLY, FOR ME AT CERTAIN TIMES, BUT I DON'T WANT TO KNOW.\" JOHNNIE KEYES, HE WAS THE BLACK GUY WITH THE SHARK TEETH AROUND HIS NECK AND, UM, VERY ETHNIC LOOKING. AND WHEN WE STARTED TO HAVE SEX, IT WAS THE KIND OF THING WHERE I WAS, LIKE, TOTALLY FREAKED OUT, I DIDN'T THINK I WAS GONNA >> I FUCKED HER FOR A LONG TIME. I FUCKED HER FOR 43 MINUTES WITHOUT STOPPING. NOBODY DOES THAT. THAT WAS A MARATHON FUCK. WHERE IT TURNED FROM TERROR TO PLEASURE, AND I REALLY BELIEVE YOU CAN SEE THAT. AND I KNOW THAT THERE WAS A TIME THAT I FELT MYSELF SLIP ON TO THE OTHER SIDE, IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN. >> UH, MARILYN, SHE PASSED OUT, SHE FAINTED. AND I-- IN MY MIND, I SAID, \"SHIT, I'M GOING TO JAIL. I DONE KILLED THIS WHITE WOMAN WITH MY DICK.\" >> WELL, THE TRAPEZES WERE A BIT MUCH. IT'S A GOOD THING I WAS IN PRETTY GOOD SHAPE, BECAUSE THERE WAS A LOT OF STANDING AROUND, LITERALLY, ON TOP OF PEOPLE, AND THERE WAS TRAPEZES AND WHATNOT. YOU HAD TO BE A GYMNAST, DEFINITELY. THE WAY THAT THE STORY OF-- WHEN \"BEHIND THE GREEN DOOR\" AND \"IVORY SOAP BOX\" CAME OUT, I TOLD THE MITCHELL BROTHERS THAT, \"OH, BY THE WAY, I DID THIS COMMERCIAL FOR PROCTER & GAMBLE, UH, IVORY SOAP BOX.\" AND THEY'RE SAYING, \"WHAT?\" WE WALKED DOWN THE SOAP AISLES, WE LOOK, AND THERE IS MY MUG ON ALL THESE BOXES, STARING DOWN AT US, AND IT JUST HAPPENED TO BE THE VERY SAME WEEK THAT \"BEHIND THE GREEN DOOR\" OPENED IN THE THEATERS. I'M NOT GONNA SAY THAT I CREATED PORNO CHIC, BUT I KNOW THAT I WAS PART OF IT. AND THAT WAS A VERY IMPORTANT TIME IN OUR HISTORY WHERE PEOPLE LIKE JOHNNY CARSON WERE WAITING IN LINE TO SEE \"DEEP THROAT.\" IT WAS COUPLES, AND IT WAS ALL DIFFERENT PEOPLE FROM DIFFERENT WALKS OF LIFE GOING TO SEE ADULT FILMS AND GETTING >> YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT I'M DEAD, AND YOU'RE TRYING TO DECIDE WHETHER TO SEND ME UP TO HEAVEN OR DOWN TO HELL. >> I REALLY HONESTLY THOUGHT NOBODY I KNEW-- MUCH LESS ANYBODY I WAS RELATED TO-- WOULD EVER KNOW ABOUT IT. I CERTAINLY DID NOT EXPECT IT TO BECOME A HOUSEHOLD WORD. >> \"THE DEVIL IN MISS JONES\" WAS DEFINITELY AN ART MOVIE, AND I'M STILL NOT REALLY 100% SURE EXACTLY WHAT THE STORY WAS. BUT I STILL THINK IT WORKED. >> CAN YOU HELP ME? I-- I SEEMED TO HAVE LOST MY WAY. >> I'LL HELP YOU ALL I CAN, BUT YOU'RE NOT LOST. >> THEN WHERE AM I? >> YOU'RE HERE. >> JERRY DAMIANO WAS THE SWEETEST GUY I EVER MET. HE LOOKED BACK OVER AT ME, AND HE SAYS, \"CAN YOU COOK?\" I SAID, \"YEAH.\" HE SAID, \"OKAY, YOU WANNA COOK ON THE FILM?\" I SAID, \"SURE.\" HE SAID, \"I GOT SOMEBODY COMING IN TO READ THE PART OF THE DEVIL IN THIS FILM I'M DOING. WOULD YOU MIND READING WITH HIM?\" AND I SAID, \"SURE, I'D BE GLAD TO.\" I'VE DONE EVERYTHING THAT I'VE BEEN TAUGHT. DOESN'T THAT COUNT FOR ANYTHING? AND HE LOOKS OVER AT ME, HE SAID, \"WOULD YOU LIKE TO PLAY MISS JONES?\" AND I SAID, \"AND COOK?\" HOW ABOUT LUST? >> LUST? >> YES, LUST. IT IS ONE OF THE SEVEN DEADLY SINS, ISN'T IT? >> HE OFFERED ME $100 A DAY TO DO MISS JONES. AND I SAID, \"THAT SOUNDS GOOD.\" SO I WAS MAKING 125 A DAY, INSTEAD OF JUST 100. >> GEORGINA WAS AMAZING. HER ACTING WAS FANTASTIC, AND THE WAY THAT SHE FUCKED WAS SO PASSIONATE. LIKE, SHE-- SHE BROUGHT ENERGY TO ALL OF THE SCENES, AND IT REALLY, REALLY SHOWED. >> FOR THAT DAY, IT WAS A BIG BUDGET FILM. I THINK THEY WERE SPENDING SOMETHING LIKE $25,000. IT DIDN'T PUT MY KIDS THROUGH COLLEGE, BUT IT CERTAINLY DID OPEN UP AN INTERESTING CAN OF WORMS FOR MY LIFE. THAT SUICIDE SCENE-- EVERY ACTOR AND ACTRESS IN THE WORLD, FROM THE BEGINNING OF TIME, WANTS TO PLAY A DEATH SCENE. >> A SUICIDE AT THE BEGINNING OF A PORN MOVIE REALLY SETS THE TONE. AND I THINK IT'S ALSO VERY BRAVE TO START A MOVIE THAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT SEX WITH DEATH. >> AH, HERMAN, HERMAN, THAT BEAUTIFUL, SWEET, AFFECTIONATE BOA, WHO COULD TURN AND LOOK AS FIERCE AS YOU WANTED HIM TO. WHAT AN ACTOR. IT WASN'T PLANNED FOR HIM TO BE IN THE FILM. AND I'M TALKING TO THE SNAKE ON THE BED, AND JERRY WALKS BY AND SKIDS TO A HALT AND SAID, \"YOU'RE A SNAKE WRANGLER.\" HE SAID, \"WOULD YOU DO A SCENE WITH IT?\" MARKS SAYS, \"$100 A DAY, SAME AS I GET.\" SO HERMAN WAS IN THE FILM. THE ANAL SCENE, WHICH EVERYONE, OF COURSE, ALWAYS ASKS ABOUT-- I DON'T KNOW-- IT'S-- IT'S A HUGE FANTASY IN EVERYONE'S MIND, I THINK, TO-- TO GIVE IT A TRY. AND WHEN IT GETS ALL BIG AND FAT AND HARD AND SLIPPERY, AND YOU COULD STICK IT IN MY ASS. GETTING FUCKED IN THE ASS IS JUST A COUPLE OF MINUTES OF-- YOU GET USED TO IT. >> ONE OF MY FAVORITE THINGS ABOUT THE SEX SCENES WAS GEORGINA'S DIRTY TALK. >> CAN YOU FEEL HIS PRICK? CAN HE FEEL YOU? CAN YOU FEEL HIM? CAN YOU FEEL YOUR COCKS TOGETHER? CAN YOU, RUBBING AGAINST MY... >> IT SO ADDED TO THE SEX SCENE. THE DIRTY-- THE DIRTY TALK WAS ONE OF THE HOTTEST THINGS OF THE MOVIE FOR ME. >> WHEN JERRY CALLED ME ABOUT A YEAR AFTER WE DID THE FILM AND SAID, \"I WANT YOU TO GO TO TORONTO FOR THIS GRAND OPENING--\" IT WAS LAVISH, IT WAS ELEGANT, IT WAS COVERED BY A MILLION CAMERAS ALL OVER THE ROOM, AND SPLASHED ALL OVER THE PLACE. AND... I SAID, \"WELL, SO MUCH FOR ANIM-- ANONYMITY NOW. I GUESS I-- I GUESS I'LL HAVE TO TELL MY PARENTS WHAT >> WHAT'S YOUR NAME? >> MISTY BEETHOVEN. >> IS THAT YOUR REAL NAME? >> NO, IT'S NOT. I THOUGHT IT WOULD SOUND MORE IMPORTANT. >> WHAT WAS IT BEFORE? I WAS CAST IN \"MISTY BEETHOVEN\" AND I FLEW TO NEW YORK, AND I MET HIM, AND HE TALKED TO ME AND EVERYTHING AND TOLD ME TO GO BACK HOME AND TO GET EVERY BIT OF CLOTHING, EVERY PHOTOGRAPH THAT HAD EVER BEEN TAKEN OF ME IN MY ENTIRE LIFE, AND BRING IT ALL BACK TO NEW YORK. >> AS HYMAN MANDEL ONCE SAID, \"NEVER LET THE FACT THAT THEY ARE DOING IT WRONG STOP YOU FROM DOING IT RIGHT.\" >> WHO WAS HYMAN MANDEL? >> I DON'T KNOW. I READ THAT ON THE MEN'S ROOM WALL AT THE NEW YORK >> IT'S A TAKE ON GEORGE BERNARD SHAW'S \"PYGMALION\" OR MODERN-DAY \"MY FAIR LADY\" OR EVEN \"SHE'S ALL THAT,\" IF YOU'RE IN THE BUT IT'S TAKING THIS WOMAN, WHO IS, LIKE, A DIME-STORE HOOKER, BASICALLY, GIVING HAND JOBS IN MOVIE THEATERS. >> EXCUSE ME, MY GUM WAS IN FRONT OF YOU. >> HOW'D YOU KNOW THAT WAS YOURS? >> FIVE SEATS IN. FIVE'S MY LUCKY NUMBER. YOU AMERICAN? >> MOST OF THE TIME. >> FIVE BUCKS FOR A HAND JOB. I'LL MEET YOU OUTSIDE IN TEN MINUTES. >> TEN MINUTES? >> MM-HMM. TEN MINUTES. I HAVE TO MEET NAPOLEON. >> NAPOLEON? >> NAPOLEON. HI. YOU'RE RIGHT ON TIME. >> JAMIE GILLIS WAS A SEXOLOGIST, AND HE WAS GOING TO TRAIN ME TO BECOME THE >> HE TAKES HER ON AS A PROJECT WHERE HE FEELS HE CAN TURN THIS LOWLY STREET GIRL INTO A >> MY DEAR, YOU ARE THE ABSOLUTE NADIR OF PASSION, THE MOST UNEXCITING THING GOD HAS EVER CREATED, A SEXUAL CIVIL SERVICE WORKER. NOBODY NEEDS TO READ MY LAST BOOK MORE OR DESERVES TO BE IN MY NEXT BOOK LESS THAN YOU. >> IT'S FASCINATING, BECAUSE YOU'RE WATCHING THIS VERY INSECURE CONSTANCE MONEY GO FROM THIS VERY UNATTRACTIVE WIG AND MAKEUP TO THE END, WHERE SHE'S BASICALLY TAKING ONE OF THE MOST PRESTIGIOUS MEN IN TOWN AND PUTTING A STRAP ON AND FUCKING HIM WITH IT. >> I WENT UP TO SEE A FELLOW BY THE NAME OF RADLEY METZGER, WHO, UH, HIS NOM DE PORN BECAME HENRY PARIS. AND, UM, UH, INSTEAD OF BEING, UH, ON THE FILM, HE'S A BIT OF A SVENGALI, AND I WOUND UP BEING IN THE FILM. YOU DON'T THINK I'M GONNA LET HIM MAKE THAT PERILOUS JOURNEY ALONE? IT WAS QUITE AN EXPERIENCE, BECAUSE I WAS UNFAMILIAR WITH WHAT BEHAVIOR AND PROTOCOL WAS SUPPOSED TO BE LIKE, UH, ON AN ADULT SET, SO IT WAS REALLY BREAKING INTO SOMETHING THAT BROKE ALL THE RULES. >> ♪ WISH I HAD HER BESIDE ME ♪ >> IT'S FUNNY-- I WASN'T EVEN AWARE-- IT WAS-- I WAS WATCHING THE FILM, BUT I WAS ROOTING FOR BOTH OF THEM TO BE TOGETHER UNTIL THE ACT-- END MOMENT WHERE SHE'S GIVING HIM A BLOW JOB, AND HE'S DEGRADING HER AS IF SHE'S NOT IN THE ROOM, UH, PRETENDING THAT SHE'S NOT THERE, AND THEN THEY HAVE THIS MOMENT WHERE THEY-- THEY COME TOGETHER. IT'S JUST-- IT'S BEAUTIFUL. >> YOU KNOW WHY MOST PEOPLE HAVE SEXUAL PROBLEMS? THEY TALK TOO GODDAMN MUCH! >> JAMIE IS A VERY SWEET PERSON ON ONE HAND, AND ON THE OTHER HAND, IS A VERY DISTURBED INDIVIDUAL. JAMIE HAD HIS DEMONS. >> YOU INSTANTLY JUST ARE SO ENGAGED BY HIM. IN FACT, WHEN I STARTED WATCHING THE-- THE OPENING IN \"MISTY BEETHOVEN,\" I WASN'T EVEN AWARE THAT JAMIE GILLIS WAS A PORN PERFORMER. I THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO NOT HAVE ANY SEX IN THE MOVIE, BECAUSE HE WAS SO GOOD. YOU THINK TO YOURSELF, \"HOW COULD THIS GUY BE A PORN ACTOR?\" >> WORKING FOR RADLEY METZGER WAS, UM-- I DON'T REALLY KNOW. I-- I DON'T KNOW HOW TO REALLY SAY IT-- IT COMES BACK TO THAT THING, \"IF YOU CAN'T SAY ANYTHING NICE...\" >> OKAY, LET'S GET YOU UNDRESSED. NO, NO, NO, YOU DON'T DO IT YOURSELF. YOU DON'T KNOW HOW, FOR ONE THING. >> HE TOLD ME HE DIDN'T THINK I COULD ACT, AND THAT'S WHY HE PUT ME THROUGH EVERYTHING. THAT WAS HIS JUSTIFICATION. >> I THINK MEN STINK. >> WELL, THEY THINK YOU STINK. IN FACT, IT'S ONE OF THE MOST PERFECTLY BALANCED EQUATIONS IN NATURE. >> I'D LIKE TO SAY THAT MOVIE WAS MADE MORE WITH BLOOD AND SWEAT THAN MONEY. HE REALLY DID MAKE A MASTERPIECE. I'VE HEARD SO MANY PEOPLE QUOTE LINES FROM IT THAT HE MUST HAVE BEEN DOING SOMETHING RIGHT. >> IT HAS AN EXTREMELY STRONG STORY WITH BEAUTIFUL IMAGERY. >> AND, ALSO, I MEAN, LOOKING AT IT ALL THESE YEARS LATER, IT WAS ALSO-- I MEAN I LOOKED PRETTY GOOD, TOO. I THINK IT WAS ALSO THE FACT THAT IT WAS MORE REALITY THAN FANTASY. >> THERE IS SO MUCH GOING ON WITHIN THAT MOVIE THAT REALLY SAYS, \"THIS IS AN ARTISTIC >> EXCUSE ME. UH, PARDON ME. DO YOU MIND IF I BLOW YOUR WAITER? >> NOT AT ALL. >> I DON'T KNOW WHAT ON EARTH HAPPENED TO MINE. >> BARBARA BROADCAST WAS A MOVIE ABOUT A WOMAN WHO IS A SEX WORKER WHO WROTE A BOOK. IT'S TAKING PLACE AT A RESTAURANT, AND PEOPLE ARE GIVING BLOW JOBS AS IF IT'S NO BIG DEAL. NOBODY'S BATTING AN EYE, NOBODY'S LOOKING AT IT PEOPLE ARE HAVING SEX ON TABLES. AND IT WAS WHAT I FEEL A TRUE ADULT SHOULD-- FILM SHOULD BE, WHERE THERE'S ABSOLUTELY ZERO JUDGMENT ABOUT EVERYTHING THAT'S GOING ON AROUND THEM. >> YES, WE'LL HAVE YOUR RESERVATION IN ABOUT FIVE MINUTES. >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. >> YOU'RE QUITE WELCOME. >> THERE'S A LOT OF JOKES IN \"BARBARA BROADCAST.\" ONE OF THEM IS WHEN THE MAITRE 'D, UM, HE RECEIVES A BLOW JOB EVERY TIME SOMEBODY DROPS A PLATE OR MESSES UP. AND IT'S JUST SO CAVALIER IN THAT HE JUST UNBUTTONS HIS PANTS, AND THEY GET DOWN ON THEIR KNEES. >> WELL, BOBBY ASTER I REMEMBER VERY WELL, BECAUSE HE'S THE VERY FIRST PERSON THAT I EVER WORKED >> ANNETTE HAVEN'S A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN, AND IT LENDS ITSELF TO THIS IDEA THAT YOU CAN BE A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN AND BE A SEXUAL WOMAN. >> MY BROTHER'S KIND OF SHY, AND, WELL, HE'S A BIG, BIG FAN OF YOURS. WELL, WOULD YOU MIND GIVING HIM AN AUTOGRAPH AND A LITTLE HEAD? >> ANNETTE, UM, WAS JUST, UH, JUST ONE OF THE MOST FLAWLESSLY BEAUTIFUL WOMAN I HAD EVER SEEN, LET ALONE I THINK IT WAS THE-- THE FIRST RED BUSH THAT I HAD EVER SEEN. SERIOUS AS A HEART ATTACK AND A GREAT BUSINESSWOMAN, AND, UH, NUTTIER THAN A FRUITCAKE AS WELL. >> IN \"BARBARA BROADCAST,\" METZGER'S USING THESE VERY WIDE SHOTS WHERE YOU'RE SEEING SEXUAL ACTIVITY HAPPENING WHILE THERE IS DIALOGUE HAPPENING BETWEEN THE MAIN CHARACTERS. THERE ALSO WAS ANOTHER JOKE IN \"BARBARA BROADCAST\" THAT I LOVED WHERE I BELIEVE IT WAS THEY ORDERED UP A NUMBER 17, WHICH, BASICALLY, WAS A MAN CAME ON A SALAD. >> HE DOES A WONDERFUL CAFE AU LAIT. >> IT'S CINEMATICALLY BEAUTIFUL, THE LOCATIONS, I MEAN, SHOOTING AT, UH, A RESTAURANT. I MEAN, THE KITCHEN SCENE WITH C.J. LAING WITH ALL THE STEAM AND THE POTS AND THE PANS AND THE THIS AND THE THAT AND... >> THEY TOOK A SCENE FROM \"MISTY BEETHOVEN,\" I UNDERSTAND, AS A FILLER FOR THE GIGANTIC CLIM-- CLIMAX OF THE FILM. >> SO WE HAVE THIS LITTLE PET WORKING FOR US, AND TO SET HER STRAIGHT, WE LET CURLY AT HER, TO ACT OUT ONE OF HIS FANTASIES. JIMMY WASN'T VERY NICE TO ME WHEN HE FIRST MET ME. THE MAKEUP LADY, SHE KEPT PUTTING MORE HAIRPIECES IN MY HAIR, MORE AND MORE HAIRPIECES. SHE SAID, \"WELL, I DON'T WANT HER BRAINS TO SPILL AND JAMIE SAID, \"WELL, IF IT'S GONNA BE REALISTIC-- IF THEY'RE GONNA COME OUT, THEY'RE GONNA COME OUT. STOP PUTTING THOSE HAIRPIECES IN HER HAIR.\" I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON. >> JAMIE WOULD CALL ME WHENEVER HE WAS IN KIND OF ONE BIND OR ANOTHER. HE SAYS, \"MITCH, YOU'VE GOTTA COME HERE RIGHT AWAY. YOU'VE GOTTA COME RIGHT-- RIGHT AWAY,\" AND I HEAR THIS, LIKE, WATER SOUND, LIKE, THIS FLUSHING SOUND. HE'S LIKE, \"HURRY, HURRY.\" SO I THREW SOMETHING ON, AND I JUMPED IN A CAB. I GET THERE, AND JAMIE WAS FUCKING C.J. FROM BEHIND, BUT HAD HER HEAD IMMERSED IN THE TOILET BOWL, AND SHE HAD A NECKLACE ON, AND THE CATCH GOT CAUGHT, AND SO HE HAD TO KEEP FLUSHING THE TOILET IN ORDER FOR HER TO GET AIR. AND I GOT THE CATCH FROM UNDERNEATH HER NECK, AND, UH, SHE COMES UP FOR AIR AND SAYS, >> I'LL GIVE YOU $10 IF YOU LET ME LOOK AT YOUR TITS. >> MR. GREENFIELD! >> PLEASE, PLEASE, I JUST WANNA LOOK AT YOUR PRETTY LITTLE TITS. >> YOU KNOW WE'RE ALL GOOD GIRLS. >> THE DIRECTOR AT THE TIME-- I'D WORKED FOR HIM QUITE A FEW TIMES-- I HELPED CAST SOME PEOPLE IN THAT FILM. I ALSO, UM, FOUND A WAY TO GET ACCESS TO BROOKLYN COLLEGE. AND WE KINDA KNEW WHEN THE FACILITIES WERE OPEN. WE-- IT WAS LIKE \"DO WHAT YOU CAN WHEN YOU CAN.\" WE JUST LUCKED OUT. WE DIDN'T GET CAUGHT DOING ANYTHING. >> I DON'T THINK I WAS EVER ON SET WHEN BAMBI WOODS WAS ON SET. MAYBE I MET HER ONE TIME. SHE WAS, FOR THAT TIME, INCREDIBLY HOT-LOOKING. >> DEBBIE, WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO? >> RAISE THE MONEY FAST. >> WHEN DO YOU HAVE TO LEAVE, DEBBIE? >> IN TWO WEEKS. >> BUT THAT'S NOT ENOUGH TIME TO RAISE THE FARE. >> THE WORST THING ABOUT \"DEBBIE DOES DALLAS\" IS R. BOLLA'S THE ONLY GUY THAT GETS TO FUCK HER. YOU WANNA FUCK THAT GIRL. I MEAN, IT'S A COMPLETE TEASE. IT'S A-- IT'S A COCK-TEASING FILM, AND IT WORKED ON THAT LEVEL. >> SIX, SEVEN, EIGHT... >> OH! >> (WHISTLE BLOWS) >> THE DALLAS COWBOYS STARTED THE WHOLE CHEERLEADER CRAZE, AND IT REALLY WENT VIRAL. IF YOU COULD USE THAT WORD BACK THEN. AND SOMEBODY WAS SMART ENOUGH TO CAPITALIZE ON THAT. THEY DIDN'T HAVE ANY IDEA IT WOULD BLOW UP LIKE IT DID. >> NO, MOM. YOU KNOW I'M GONNA STAY WITH YOU. >> OH, DARLING, I'M SO GLAD. KIRDY STEVENS. WE MET-- WE MET AT A RESTAURANT IN, UM, WEST L.A., AND HE TOLD ME IT WAS ABOUT INCEST, AND I SAID, \"NO, ABSOLUTELY NOT.\" >> I LOVED \"TABOO\" AS A MOVIE. IN FACT, THE ENDING WAS SO DISTURBING AND BOTHERSOME TO ME THAT SHE DIDN'T END UP WITH HER SON, IT MADE ME QUESTION MY OWN >> HE PERSISTED, AND THEN, UM, AGAIN, I-- I CAN ONLY DESCRIBE THIS AS MY HIGHER SELF JUMPED IN AND SAID, \"DO IT.\" BECAUSE SOMEBODY'S GOING TO DO IT. YOU-- IF YOU DO IT, YOU CAN BRING CONSCIOUSNESS AND QUALITY TO IT, SO DO IT. >> WE ARE CENSORING OURSELVES FROM DOING THINGS THAT ARE AS FREE AND AS OPEN AS THEY WERE 35 YEARS AGO. I MEAN THEY WERE MORE FREE 35 YEARS AGO. >> I HATED THE SCRIPT THE FIRST TIME I READ IT. IT WAS-- IT WAS REALLY DIFFICULT TO, UM-- TO READ ABOUT INCEST IN SUCH A SORT OF FLIPPANT, UM, MANNER. BUT IT WAS SO WRONG. >> LOOK, MA, I DON'T THINK ANY LESS OF EITHER ONE OF US. IT HAPPENED, AND I GOTTA TELL YA, I WANT IT TO HAPPEN AGAIN. >> DON'T-- DON'T... NO, PAUL, DON'T. THE WORLD HAS A DIRTY WORD FOR THIS. >> THERE'S THESE-- THESE MOMENTS THAT KIND OF MAKE YOU SAY, \"WHOA!\" THESE JARRING MOMENTS, LIKE, FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN KAY PARKER IS IN THE KITCHEN, AND HER BREAST IS HANGING OUT OF HER SHIRT, AND SHE'S STANDING THERE WITH HER SON, AND IT'S ALMOST AS IF THERE'S NO COVERING UP, AND IT-- IT'S JUST, AGAIN, SEX IS OUT THERE. >> I MEAN I'M NOT EXACTLY OVER-THE-HILL, YOU KNOW. >> YOU'RE TELLING ME. >> YOU SEE IT A LOT WITH KAY PARKER'S FRIEND IN THE MOVIE, WHO IS HAVING ORGIES AND-- AND DOESN'T HAVE ANY ISSUES WITH-- SHE THINKS IT'S HOT IMAGINING THAT HER SON WOULD BE HAVING SEX WITH HER. SHE REFERENCES THAT KAY PARKER IS, YOU KNOW, HAS BEEN KIND OF ASSAULTED BY HER BOSS. AND SHE'S ON THE PHONE WITH HER FRIEND, AND THE FRIEND SAYS... >> WHAT'S GOING ON OVER THERE? IS JERRY RAPING YOU? >> CUT THAT OUT, YOU SON-OF- A-BITCH! >> WHAT'S HE DOING? DOES HE HAVE HIS COCK OUT? >> BUT IT-- IT-- IT LENDS ITSELF TO THIS IDEA THAT THERE'S LOTS OF DIFFERENT THINGS THAT PEOPLE FIND SEXUALLY AROUSING, EVEN IF IT IS NEC-- EVEN IF IT IS FORBIDDEN. >> WHENEVER I THINK ABOUT THE-- THE SCENE, THE SEDUCTION SCENE WITH MIKE RANGER IN \"TABOO,\" I-- I GET GOOSEFLESH-- I'M GETTING RIGHT NOW, AS I-- AS I GET READY TO TALK ABOUT IT, BECAUSE I DO REFER TO IT AS A VERY, UM, SPIRITUAL EXPERIENCE. >> SHE'S JUST LEFT THIS ORGY PARTY THAT SHE FELT EXTREMELY UNCOMFORTABLE AND DID NOT PARTICIPATE IN, AND SHE JUST FINDS IT WITHIN HERSELF THAT SHE MUST HAVE SEX, AND HE'S SAFE FOR HER. HE IS SAFE. >> (GROANING) >> I LOST MYSELF IN THAT SCENE. I WAS NOT THERE. I SURRENDERED, IF YOU WILL, TO THE PART, AND THE PART, OR THE ROLE, THE MOTHER, JUST TOOK ME, UM, ON THIS TRIP. >> IT WAS ALMOST LIKE, YES, THIS IS THE NATURAL THING THAT SHOULD HAPPEN BETWEEN MY MOTHER AND I. THAT'S-- >> (INTERVIEWER) I'M APPALLED. >> THERE'S NOTHING WRONGER >> WHAT'LL IT BE, GENTS? >> OH, THE MASTER WILL HAVE A BEER, ANYTHING IMPORTED. >> BOTTLE OF BUFFALO PISS, PLEASE. >> THE AMERO BROTHERS MADE A BIG BUDGET COMEDY. WE JUST HAD A LOT OF FUN. I SWEAR, THE BURNING OF ATLANTA SCENE OR WHATEVER WAS THE FUNNIEST THING I'VE EVER >> NOW, REMEMBER, PAY NO ATTENTION TO ME WHEN I'M TALKING TO YOU, JUST DO WHAT I SAY. THIS IS A VERY SIMPLE LITTLE SCENE I'D LIKE TO GET DONE QUICKLY, BECAUSE WE ARE SHOOTING THE BOMBING OF ATLANTA THIS AFTERNOON. >> (ALL SCREAMING) >> IT WAS FUNNY AND QUIRKY. IT WAS-- IT WAS VERY HORNY, IT HAD SO MANY SEX SCENES. I WAS REALLY IMPRESSED. >> I DID IT IN A BOAT ONCE, AND I HAD TO DO ALL THE ROWING. >> R. BOLLA AND I ARE IN WYOMING, WHERE WE MEET THE CANE SISTERS. I DECIDE TO TAKE THEM TO NEW YORK WITH US, AND-- AND SHE SAYS SOMETHING LIKE, \"WHAT, YOU GOT AN AIRPLANE?\" >> ANYWAY, I'M TO BE QUEEN OF THE FAIRIES, AND I'VE GOT THIS TERRIFIC GOWN RIGGED UP. >> A GOWN? ARE YOU ONE OF THOSE TRANSYLVANIANS? >> SUSIE MANDELL WAS THE-- MY FAVORITE OF THE TWO CHARACTERS. >> CANDY, WHAT'S A FILM LOOP? >> YOU'VE GOT ME. >> THEY'RE LOOKING FOR 46 GIRLS AND A MONKEY. >> IT WAS REALLY A TRIBUTE TO THE, UH, MGM MOVIES, ONLY WITH HARDCORE SEX. >> FUCK. >> THE RAPE SCENE WHERE THE YANKEES CAME IN AND, LIKE, BANGED ALL THE CHICKS. >> I WANT A CUM SHOT, OR NONE OF YOU FAGGOTS GET PAID! >> \"BLONDE AMBITION\" WAS PLAYING IN NEW YORK-- THE R-RATED VERSION AT ONE THEATER, AND THE X-RATED VERSION AT >> IT'S SANDY, AM I RIGHT? OH, BUT THERE IS AN AMAZING RESEMBLANCE. BUT NOW THAT I LOOK AT YOU, >> WELL, IS MY SISTER HERE OR NOT? >> \"NEON NIGHTS\" HAD A VERY VERONICA HART PLAYED A MADAME, AND I WAS KIND OF HER BOY-TOY, >> I'M GONNA MAKE YOU SWEAT, BABY. YOU'RE MY PRIVATE FUCKING >> THE FILM WAS ACTUALLY KIND OF FUCKED UP. UM, THE DAUGHTER IS LISTENING TO HER MOM AND HER MOM'S BOYFRIEND AND THEN SHE STARTS MASTURBATING WITH A HAIRBRUSH. AND THEN SHE'S IN THE BATHROOM, AND HE COMES IN, AND HE'S TELLING HER TO SHUSH AND TURN AROUND, AND HE'S GRABBING ON HER AND TOUCHING HER. >> NO. >> TURN AROUND, COME ON. TURN AROUND, BABY. THAT'S A GIRL. THAT'S A GOOD GIRL. >> WHEN JAKE TEAGUE MAKES LYSA THATCHER ELEVATE, THEY DID IT VERY WELL, LIKE, HE WAS PUTTING HIS ARMS UNDERNEATH HER BUTT AND OVER HER BOOBS AND OVER HER VAGINA AND, LIKE, DOING THE WHOLE CREEPY THING, AND THEN I LOVE HOW HE GOT IN HER MIND. HE WAS HAVING SEX WITH ANOTHER WOMAN WHILE HE WAS INSIDE OF HER MIND, AND SHE WAS FEELING EVERYTHING THAT HIM AND THE OTHER WOMAN WERE DOING. I THOUGHT THAT WAS PRETTY INTERESTING. >> SO VERONICA, BACK HOME, IS TAKING A SHOWER, AND A LA HITCHCOCK IN \"PSYCHO,\" UH, I ENTER-- BUT I HAD SOME FLOWERS-- AND I PULL BACK THE CURTAIN, AND SHE SCREAMS. >> (SCREAMING) ♪♪ (STRINGS SHRIEKING) >> GOTCHA! OH, MAN, WERE YOU EVER GOIN'! >> NO! >> PEEING IN YOUR PANTS, YOU WERE SO SCARED. >> YOU FUCK! >> SHE'S ALL PISSED OFF AT THAT, AND THEN WE GO OFF IN THE BEDROOM AND MAKE REALLY FRANTIC AND HARD, HARD SEX. >> I THOUGHT HE DID VERY WELL AT KEEPING THE PLOT TOGETHER AND MAKING IT AN INTERESTING MOVIE THAT IS, NOT ONLY RISKY AND DIFFERENT AND VERY INTERESTING WITH THE MAGICIAN AND HER HITCH-HIKING AND BEING IN LOVE WITH HER MOTHER'S BOYFRIEND, >> I WANNA GIVE IT A TRY. I DON'T WANNA LOOK BACK WITH REGRETS. YOU KNOW, IF ONLY I'D GONE TO NEW YORK, I COULD'VE BEEN >> THE PLOT OF \"ROOMMATES\" IS SHE HAPPENS TO BE A HOOKER, AND SHE DECIDES TO GET OUT OF THE BUSINESS. AND HER APARTMENT'S TOO BIG FOR HER, SO SHE CONSIGNS TWO ROOMMATES TO COME >> WELL, THERE YOU HAVE IT-- >> ONE WAS, UH, A BEAUTIFUL, GORGEOUS MODEL, WHO, UNFORTUNATELY, SEEMED TO HAVE A DRUG PROBLEM AND GET IN AND I PLAYED A COLLEGE STUDENT WHO, ACTUALLY, I THINK, RAN AWAY FROM COLLEGE. I WAS HAVING AN AFFAIR WITH MY COLLEGE PROFESSOR, AND IT FINALLY DAWNED ON ME THAT HE DIDN'T LOVE ME AT ALL. >> MY CHARACTER HAD SOME BAD PEOPLE IN HER LIFE, AND, UH, STUFF HAPPENS BECAUSE I RUN RAMPANT, AND I KIND OF LEARN MY LESSON. WHERE AM I? >> YOU'RE IN QUEENS. WHERE THE FUCK DO YOU THINK YOU ARE? >> THE FAMOUS RAPE SCENE FROM \"ROOMMATES.\" SO MUCH OF IT WAS INFERRED. THE BACKS OF THE ACTORS WERE TO THE CAMERA. I WAS LAYING ON THE FLOOR. >> RUB SOME ON HER FACE, SAL, RUB IT IN. MAKE HER EAT IT. >> AGAIN, YOU HEAR THE SOUNDS, YOU HEAR THEIR VOICES, YOU CAN ONLY IMAGINE THE WORST POSSIBLE THING IS HAPPENING TO ME. JAMIE GILLIS COMES BURSTING IN, STARTS KNOCKING THE GUYS ASIDE, AND THEN JAMIE STARTS DOING JAMIE GILLIS. >> DID THEY HURT YOU? >> NO. >> LET ME SEE IF THEY HURT YOU. THEY STUCK THE BOTTLE-- DID THEY HURT YOU WITH-- DID THEY HURT YOU WITH THE BOTTLE WHEN THEY-- WHEN THEY SHOVED IT IN? >> HE'S NOT THERE TO HELP ME, HE'S THERE TO JERK OFF ON ME, YOU KNOW? SICK, TWISTED JAMIE GILLIS. >> HE WASN'T INTERESTED IN DEGRADING ANYBODY, YOU KNOW? CHUCK'S IDEA OF A GREAT TIME WAS TO-- TO HAVE FUN. >> (LAUGHING) COME ON, YOU GUYS ARE ANIMALS. TAKE A BREAK ALREADY. IT DIDN'T FIT INTO ANY CATEGORY. SO CHUCK REALLY WENT OUT ON A LIMB TO MAKE THIS. IT WAS ONE OF THE FIRST MOVIES WHERE EVERYBODY WASN'T RUNNING AROUND, GOING \"FUCK ME, FUCK ME, FUCK ME.\" >> IN THE END OF THE 1970s, THEATRICAL PORN FILMS BEGIN TO STRUGGLE. OBSCENITY PROSECUTIONS ROSE, ZONING LAWS HAD FORCED ADULT THEATERS INTO THE WORST NEIGHBORHOODS, AND THE PORN CHIC THAT FUELED TICKET SALES DIED OUT. BUT THERE WAS A NEW FRONTIER OPENING FOR ADULT MOVIE PRODUCERS-- THE VCR WAS ABOUT TO REDEFINE THE PORN INDUSTRY >> WHEN DID PEOPLE START TO BUY VHS's? WHEN WAS THAT STARTING TO BE THE NORM VERSUS, UH, GOING TO THE THEATER? >> IN THE MID-'70s, THE MACHINES CAME OUT, AND PEOPLE THOUGHT THIS WAS THE GREATEST INVENTION AND THEY HAD TO HAVE ONE-- YOU HAD TO GO OUT. BUT, LIKE YOU SAID, THEY WERE EXPENSIVE. THEY WERE $1,000 A MACHINE. AND THE MOVIES THEMSELVES WERE $95. THEY WOULD HAVE PARTIES, THOUGH. THEY WOULD GO IN AND CHIP IN >> THERE WAS MORE WORK THAN-- THAN GIRLS IN THE BUSINESS. LIKE, THERE WERE, LIKE, 12 OF US REALLY IN THE BUSINESS, IT SEEMED, AND I THINK WE ALL I MEAN, IT WAS JUST-- THE-- THE PRODUCERS COULDN'T GET ENOUGH GIRLS. >> SO WHAT WAS IT LIKE SHOOTING-- WHAT WAS A DAY ONSET LIKE BACK THEN? >> UM, LET'S SEE, THERE WAS USUALLY A SCRIPT, LIKE, A 20-PAGE SCRIPT, WHICH ALWAYS IRRITATED ME, 'CAUSE I WAS NOT GOOD AT MEMORIZING THINGS. IT WAS ALWAYS SHOT AT, LIKE, A REALLY NICE HOUSE, THE LOCATION-- NOT ALWAYS, BUT FOR THE MOST PART IT WAS, YOU KNOW, SHOT IN REALLY NICE HOUSES UP IN PORN VALLEY SOMEWHERE. THEY ALWAYS HAD CATERING, HAIR, AND MAKEUP. I MEAN, IT WAS LIKE-- IN A WEIRD WAY, IT WAS KINDA LIKE BEING ON A REAL MOVIE SET, ONLY WE WERE NAKED HAVING SEX. >> YOU COULD ACTUALLY SEE THE PLAYBACK AT-- ON THE SET. IT WAS LIKE A WHOLE NEW WORLD. BUT THE VIDEO QUALITY IN THOSE DAYS WAS NOT THE BEST. BUT EVERYBODY WANTED TO DO IT BECAUSE IT WAS CHEAP, IT WAS QUICK, IT WAS PAINLESS. >> SO, AS A PERFORMER, WHAT... DID THE CONSUMERS SORT OF EXPECT FROM YOU? LIKE, WERE YOU GUYS SHOOTING A LOT OF CRAZY SEX ACTS? >> NUDITY. NO. >> OR DID THEY WANT YOU TO BE A GOOD ACTRESS? DID THEY CARE? DID THEY JUST WANNA SEE YOUR-- >> I THINK, IN 1984, THEY WERE JUST HAPPY THAT THEY COULD WATCH A FILM IN THEIR HOUSE OF A NAKED GIRL SUCKING A GUY'S DICK. LIKE, THERE WAS DEFINITELY NO CRAZY SEX ACTS LIKE THERE ARE-- I MEAN, IT WAS KINDA LIKE, YOU KNOW, THE TYPICAL THREE POSITIONS, HEAD, HIM EATING ME OUT, BUT IT WASN'T CRAZY SEX. I REALLY THINK, BACK IN '84, PEOPLE WERE JUST SO HAPPY THAT THEY COULD WATCH PEOPLE HAVE SEX >> GOOD EVENING, MUTANTS AND MUTETTES, AND WELCOME TO >> THE STORYLINE IS THERE'S BEEN THING AND, IN THE WAKE OF THAT, STILL STAND THE TOUCH OF ANOTHER HUMAN BEING, AND THE REST OF THEM CAN'T. >> TRUST ME, FOLKS, I KNOW WHAT YOU WANT, AND I KNOW WHAT IT FEELS LIKE WHEN YOU DON'T GET IT. NEED IS MY FIX, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. >> AND SO THE PEOPLE WHO CAN TOUCH OTHER PEOPLE AND, THEREFORE, HAVE SEX ARE FORCED TO STAGE THESE LIVE SEX SHOWS FOR THE PEOPLE WHO CAN'T HAVE SEX LIKE THAT. IT'S, LIKE, WEIRD AND EXPERIMENTAL, BUT THEN IT'S GOT THIS VERY OBVIOUS METAPHOR ABOUT PORNOGRAPHY AND ITS PLACE IN THE WORLD. >> LEAVING SO SOON, FRIEND? FEELING A LITTLE QUEASY? >> LIVE THEATER, ON THE OTHER HAND, AND THE HISTORY OF LIVE THEATER, YOU CAN SEE A LOT OF WHERE \"CAFE FLESH'S\" REFERENCES PROBABLY CAME FROM. >> \"CAFE FLESH\" STANDS THE TEST OF TIME BECAUSE IT'S A PORNO ABOUT PORNO. IT, IT VERY MUCH IS WHAT IT IS, AND THERE'S SOMETHING SO WONDERFULLY HONEST ABOUT IT. BUT THEN IT'S GOT ALL OF THE OTHER LAYERS, SO IT REMAINS INTERESTING. I MEAN, YOU WATCH IT SIX OR SEVEN TIMES, YOU'RE STILL GONNA >> DOES IT EVER BOTHER YOU FUCKING YOUR BEST FRIEND'S WIFE? >> (CHUCKLING) YOU'RE IN >> \"SCOUNDRELS\" WAS THE FIRST FILM TO WIN A BEST PICTURE AWARD AND HOWARD SAID TO ME, CECIL HOWARD, \"YOU'RE NOT GONNA CRACK ONE JOKE IN THIS. YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE-- NO MUGGING TO THE CAMERA. YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE A HAM.\" >> RON JEREMY SCARED ME AT THAT TIME, UM... IT WAS, IT WAS REALLY ODD BECAUSE, BEFORE I HAD MET RON JEREMY, I HADN'T HEARD ANYTHING ABOUT HIM, UM, BUT HIS HEADSHOT TO ME LOOKED LIKE >> HOWARD WAS A TOUGH GUY. CECIL HOWARD WAS TOUGH. HE WANTED THINGS HIS WAY. BUT I RESPECT THAT. >> I REALLY ENJOYED WORKING WITH CECIL HOWARD, AND HE WAS ONE OF MY FAVORITE DIRECTORS, AND I WORKED FOR HIM >> EVERYTHING IN THE MOVIE IS VERY DARK LIT AND VERY DARK IN GENERAL. THE DRAMA OF THE MOVIE, I THINK, >> AH, I'M GONNA CHANGE. >> THAT'LL BE THE DAY. >> IT'S A FASCINATING PSYCHODRAMA. THROUGHOUT THE MOVIE, I'M IN CLOWN WHITE TALKING ABOUT MY LIFE. >> I'VE BEEN GOOD. I'VE BEEN REAL GOOD. FUCK IT, NOBODY TELLS THE TRUTH ALL THE TIME. >> EVERYBODY'S FUCKING EVERYBODY IN THIS MOVIE, BUT IT'S NOT A HAPPY-GO-LUCKY THING, YOU KNOW. THE DOCTOR IS CHEATING ON HIS, UM, HIS WIFE WITH HIS SECRETARY. AND, YOU KNOW, HIS SECRETARY'S CHEATING ON HIM WITH HIS BEST FRIEND WHO, I BELIEVE, HIS WIFE IS ALSO SLEEPING WITH. (SIGHING) AND THEN THEY HAVE THIS TEENAGE DAUGHTER WHO FEELS INVISIBLE. >> MY PERFECT PARENTS. THEY DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT ME. WHAT DO I LIKE? I LIKE MAKING LOVE. >> SO SHE'S TAKING IT OUT BY BECOMING A WHORE AND HAVING ALL THE SEX IN THE WORLD THAT SHE CAN. >> SHE'S THE GIRL AT THE CANDY STORE ON THE CORNER. THAT'S WHY I GET TO SEE HER EVERY DAY, AND THEN FINALLY, I JUST TELL HER TO HOP IN. SHE GETS IN MY CAR, AND WE'RE GONNA ESCAPE AND RUN AWAY. >> MY MOM ALWAYS TOLD ME I SHOULD MARRY A DOCTOR. (HORN HONKING) (SCREAMING) >> WE CRASH MY CAR AND DIE. WHICH IS CERTAINLY A STATEMENT AGAINST INFIDELITY, YOU KNOW? >> EVERYBODY HAS A DARK SIDE, AND IT'S REALLY HARD TO HIDE NO MATTER HOW PRETTY YOUR SURROUNDINGS ARE. AND THIS MOVIE REALLY DIGS INTO EVERYBODY'S SEXUALLY DEVIANT DARK SIDE. >> NO ONE FILMS LIKE THAT ANYMORE. CECIL HOWARD, CHUCK VINCENT, RADLEY METZGER, HENRI PACHARD, ANTHONY SPINELLI ON THE WEST COAST, THESE GUYS MADE FILMS WHICH HAD SEX IN IT. >> BY THE WAY, WHAT'S YOUR NAME? >> ELIZABETH. >> THAT'S A NICE NAME. >> SPINELLI, HIS NAME WAS SAM, HE WAS THE BACKBONE HE WAS MORE THAN, UH, A TALENTED DIRECTOR. HE WAS MAKING THE BEST MOVIES. AND HE BECAME A FRIEND AND A MENTOR. >> ANTHONY SPINELLI... >> WHO IS... >> HE WAS MY-- HE'S A DIRECTOR. HE'S MY DAD. IT WAS A GREAT TEAM. HE WOULD USUALLY SAY, \"I HAVE AN IDEA.\" AND I'D GO, AND I'D WRITE THE ROUGH DRAFT, AND WE, UH, SHOWED IT TO HIM, AND WE-- GREAT COLLABORATION, >> THE PLOT OF \"NOTHING TO HIDE\" REALLY REMINDED ME OF \"OF MICE AND MEN.\" AND I THINK THAT THAT'S REALLY DIFFERENT FOR A PORN MOVIE. HOW TO BE A MAN. AND \"LOVE'S FOR SUCKERS,\" HE'S TEACHING ME. AND I FALL IN LOVE, AND I WANNA MARRY. >> HAVE YOU EVER LOVED SOMEBODY? >> NO. >> HAVE YOU EVER WANTED TO LOVE SOMEBODY? >> NO. >> I THINK THAT THERE IS PARTS OF THIS MOVIE THAT YOU CAN JERK-OFF TO. >> SLOW AND DEEP. >> AS LONG AS YOU'RE INTO JOHN LESLIE. ONE OF THE SCENES IN THERE HAS SOMETHING FOR MOST PEOPLE TO JERK OFF TO. >> OH, JACK! >> I'M NOT SURE YOU CAN JERK OFF TO THE RICHARD PACHECO SCENE. >> NONE OF THE WOMEN THAT HAD COME BY FIT WHAT SAM WANTED TO COME OUT OF THAT CHARACTER. >> AH! WHY DON'T YOU WATCH WHERE YOU'RE GOING?! >> SHE WAS PERFECT. >> THE SEX SCENE BETWEEN RICHARD AND CHELSEA WAS MY FAVORITE. IT WAS SO REAL. >> I SORT OF GOT MY-- SOME SPITTLE ON MY FINGER AND PLAYED WITH HER NIPPLE AND... \"NO, NO, NO, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? LENNY WOULD NEVER DO THAT!\" >> SEE? >> OH, IS THAT A RUBBER? >> HOW'D YOU KNOW? >> I SAW ONE IN MY BROTHER'S DRAWER. >> I'VE NEVER SEEN THAT IN A PORN MOVIE BEFORE WHERE THEY ACTUALLY STOP THE SEX TO PUT ON A CONDOM, AND THEY TALK ABOUT PUTTING ON THE CONDOM AND HOW SHE'S NEVER DONE THAT BEFORE, AND IT JUST-- IT WAS SO, SO REAL. I LOVED IT. >> THERE'S A GREAT AWKWARDNESS AND PLAYFULNESS ABOUT WINNING THIS, ABOUT PUTTING ON THE CONDOM 'CAUSE IT'S PLAYED, PLAYED REALISTICALLY. SPINELLI PLAYED THE OWNER OF A HOT DOG STAND. >> YOU DON'T FOOL ME. YOU DON'T WANNA STOP BEING A MOTHER AND A FATHER, RIGHT? >> HE AND JOHN HAVE A LONG SCENE WHERE THEY TALK ABOUT, YOU KNOW, \"YOU'RE JUST JEALOUS IS WHAT IT IS.\" YOU'RE GONNA LOSE THE KID. WHEN AVN DID THEIR FIRST AWARDS, THEY GAVE ME BEST ACTOR FOR \"IRRESISTIBLE\", AND THEY ALSO GAVE ME BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR FOR \"NOTHING TO HIDE.\" THAT PROBABLY WAS THE >> FOR SEVERAL MONTHS, I'VE BEEN WRITING STORIES, NOT FOR PUBLICATION BUT FOR A VERY CURIOUS MAN, A PRIVATE CLITEROTICA. >> JANINE AND I BECAME BEST FRIENDS WHEN WE WERE 18 AND 19 YEARS OLD. AND I DON'T THINK EITHER OF US REALLY KNEW WHAT TO BE TOTALLY PREPARED FOR. I THINK SHE'D DONE SOME... SHE'D BEEN A \"PENTHOUSE\" PET SO SHE'D DONE SOME \"PENTHOUSE\" VIDEOS, BUT NOT EXACTLY THE HARDCORE WE WERE ABOUT READY TO GET INVOLVED IN. >> WORKING WITH ANDREW BLAKE, HE'S, UM... HE'S VERY UNDERSTATED, YOU KNOW, QUIET GUY, BUT HIS WHEELS ARE ALWAYS >> ANDREW BLAKE IS THE QUINTESSENTIAL ARTIST. I MEAN, HE'S QUIRKY. HE'S INTERESTING. SOMEWHAT INTROVERTED. BIT OF A RECLUSE, UH, EXCEPT FOR WHEN HE'S FILMING, AND I THINK THAT'S KIND OF WHEN IT ALL >> I HIRED THIS GUY TO MAKE THESE-- HE MADE, LIKE, >> AND BOY, AT THE BEGINNING, THERE'S SOME MIGHTY HEFTY ONES. THEY WERE QUITE BIG. >> AND WHEN HE ARRIVED ON THE SET, HE WAS BLOODY, AND HE HAD CUT HIMSELF, AND HE NEEDED TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL. AND HE DROPPED OFF THE DILDOS, AND, YOU KNOW, I NEVER HEARD FROM HIM AGAIN. (CHUCKLING) >> AND, OF COURSE, BY THE TIME WE WERE DONE, WE WERE COMPLETELY NUMB. >> I DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE ADULT INDUSTRY. AT THAT TIME OF MAKING \"HIDDEN OBSESSIONS,\" I HAD NEVER HEARD OF VIVID. I KNEW NOTHING ABOUT THE BIG-BUDGET CONTRACT GIRLS AND WHAT HAVE YOU. >> I MEAN, BASICALLY, I'M ONE TO FLY UNDER THE RADAR. THAT WAS THE WRONG FIRST SCENE TO EVER DO. >> I'M THE LAST MAN STANDING, UH, STILL SHOOTING FILM. WHEN I'M 80, AND I'M STILL SHOOTING SOME 19-YEAR-OLD GIRL, AND I WANNA KEEL OVER, AND MY BOLEX GOES INTO HER PUSSY. THAT'S WHAT I ENVISION FOR >> WELL, I GUESS THESE ARE FOR IF YOU'RE LONELY AT NIGHT AND, UH, NEED SOMEONE TO TALK TO. >> YEAH. >> I TOOK THE IDEA OF \"JUSTINE\" FROM A FRENCH FILM BY, UM, A DIRECTOR NAMED LOUIS MALLE. IT'S ABOUT A FATHER WHO FALLS FOR HIS SON'S GIRLFRIEND. >> I SAID, I'VE SEEN IT. AND HE SAID, \"WHAT'D YOU THINK?\" AND I SAID, \"I HATED IT.\" HE SAID, \"YOU HATED IT, WHY?\" I SAID, \"BECAUSE OF THE MORALITY THAT THIS MAN WOULD DESTROY HIS SON AND HIS WIFE FOR THE SAKE OF >> IT WAS AN EVENT OF MY... SORT OF... HAVING A SON WHO'S IN SOME WAYS MORE GROWN-UP THAN ME. HE'S TELLING ME, YOU KNOW, >> WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME WHAT YOU'RE THINKING. >> I'M THINKING ABOUT MY FATHER. >> YOUR FATHER? >> IN \"DAMAGE\", UH, JEREMY IRONS IS THE FATHER. HE KNEW THAT THIS WAS HIS SON'S GIRLFRIEND. HE DIDN'T CARE. >> BUT IN OUR MOVIE, THE FATHER WOULD NOT DESTROY HIS SON. HE WOULD GIVE UP THE GIRL BECAUSE HIS SON IS HIS SON. >> MMM. WOULD YOU LIKE A TASTE? >> I LIKE OUR VERSION BETTER. >> ROXANNE BLAZE HAD A SERIES OF ENDLESS ORGASMS FROM A WATER HOSE I WAS SPRAYING HER WITH. AND THAT WAS VERY REAL, IT WAS VERY INTERESTING. >> SHE'S ONE OF HIS GIRLS, HE WOULD LOOK AND-- AND SAY, \"WHAT'S A NICE GIRL LIKE YOU DOING IN A PLACE LIKE THIS?\" WHY'D YOU COME BACK, HMM? >> BECAUSE I SHOULDN'T HAVE. BECAUSE YOU'RE DANGEROUS FOR ME. >> WE REALLY FELT WHAT WE WERE DOING-- YOU KNOW, WE KNEW IT WAS ONLY PORN. BUT WE WANTED TO MAKE IT THE BEST PORN WE COULD POSSIBLY MAKE IT. >> \"JUSTINE\" DOES QUALIFY AS ONE OF THE BETTER MOVIES MADE, UH, UH, BOTH IN THE HISTORY OF PORN, BUT IN MY PERSONAL HISTORY WORKING. IT WOULD BE IN MY TOP TEN >> MY CRIME WAS TO SHARE THESE VISIONS WITH YOU. THE TRUTH. AND FOR THIS, I HAVE BEEN >> \"LATEX\" WAS VERY INEXPENSIVE BUT THEN THERE WAS ABOUT 12 MONTHS OF POST MAKING ALL OF THIS STUFF, SO THAT MIGHT'VE THIS IS A WHOLE MOVIE FULL OF COMPUTER-GENERATED EFFECTS. THIS WAS SO FAR BEFORE ANYBODY EVER THOUGHT TO DO ANYTHING LIKE THAT FOR PORNO, YOU KNOW? EVERYBODY WHO WORKED ON A MICHAEL NINN FEATURE KNEW THEY WERE IN FOR A RIDE. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE NOT GONNA WALK IN AND BE OUT OF THERE IN AN HOUR. UH, MORE OFTEN THAN NOT, IT MIGHT TAKE YOU A COUPLE OF HOURS JUST TO GET YOUR MAKEUP ON. HE SAYS THAT YOU CLAIMED TO BE ABLE TO \"SEE INSIDE OF PEOPLE.\" DID YOU SAY THAT? >> YES. >> I'D CALL THAT E.S.P., WOULDN'T YOU? >> I WOULD CALL IT SEEING >> JON DOUGH REALLY TOOK HOLD OF THAT ROLE AND CREATED THAT ROLE ALMOST ON HIS OWN. UM, MICHAEL NINN MADE IT INTO VISUALLY POWERFUL MOVIE AND TECHNICALLY FAR SUPERIOR THAN MOST EVERYTHING ELSE THAT HAD BEEN MADE BEFORE THAT. >> YOU'RE ASKING ME TO EXPLAIN SOMETHING THAT I DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND MYSELF. >> HE WAS SO DEEPLY DEDICATED TO WHAT WAS GOING IN THERE, MORE THAN I EVER SAW HIM IN ANY MOVIE. >> THERE WAS ONE SET, THE KITCHEN SET WITH ZACK AND SUNSET THOMAS. THAT'S THE ONLY SET WE SHOT ON. EVERYTHING ELSE WAS SHOT AGAINST GREEN SCREEN, WHICH MEANS EVERYTHING ELSE IN THE MOVIE HAD TO BE MANUFACTURED >> I'M IN THE KITCHEN, YOU KNOW, LATEX GLOVES ON. AND THERE'S THESE BIG, WHITE AND I WAS IN THE DRESSING ROOM. I WAS JUST ALL UPSET BECAUSE I WAS SO USED WEARING THESE LITTLE SKIMPY UNDERWEAR. I SAID, \"MIKE, I CANNOT WEAR THESE GRANNY UNDERWEAR.\" >> MICHAEL NINN SEEMS TO DEAL MORE WITH, UM, BROAD SYMBOLISM, LIKE, SYMBOLIC STORIES. THEY WERE HUGE STORIES THAT TALKED ABOUT BASICALLY GOOD AND EVIL. THERE'S ALWAYS THE INNOCENCE THAT GETS CORRUPTED. THERE'S THE, THE SOCIETY THAT CHURNS UP THE INNOCENTS IN ITS GEARS, IT'S-- IT'S VERY SYMBOLIC AND BROAD IN ITS SCOPE, AND I THINK ANDREW BLAKE WAS MORE ABOUT INSTANCES. >> HOME VIDEO BECAME SUCH A POPULAR FORMAT FOR PORN THAT, BY THE MID-90'S, ADULT THEATERS WERE ESSENTIALLY A THING OF THE PAST. PRODUCERS TRADED NEW YORK AND SAN FRANCISCO FOR SUNNY L.A., AND THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY BECAME THE UNDISPUTED CAPITAL OF THE ADULT BUSINESS. VHS AND THE INDUSTRY SEEMED LIKE A MARRIAGE THAT WOULD LAST FOREVER. BUT PROGRESS NEVER STANDS STILL. AND A POWERFUL NEW FORMAT WAS ABOUT TO BRING NEW OPTIONS AND >> WHY ARE YOU GOING THROUGH MY PURSE? >> TO FIND YOUR BADGE. YOUR FIREMAN I.D. >> YOU'RE THE KIND OF GIRL WHO TAKES OUT PERSONAL ADS. \"OH, HOT-BLOODED BLONDE >> IT WAS SHORTLY AFTER \"BACKDRAFT,\" THAT BIG FIREMAN AND WHEN IT CAME TO \"FLASHPOINT,\" WHAT WE WERE TRYING TO DO IS WE HAD KIND OF STARTED TO ELEVATE OUR ADULT MOVIES INTO WHAT WE THOUGHT SEX OUT OF THEM, BECOME KIND OF LIKE THAT \"B\" MOVIE VIBE. >> I JUST WISH I HAD IT HAD A STORYLINE. AND IT HAD REAL ACTING. >> FOR ITS TIME, IT WAS A HUGE MOVIE, AND, UH, AS LUCK WOULD HAVE IT, I JUST HAPPENED TO MEET A BIG PYROTECHNICS GUY WHO WORKED IN THE MAINSTREAM. >> THEY ACTUALLY WORKED ON \"BACKDRAFT.\" >> WHEN WORKING WITH FIRE, OF COURSE, THERE'S ALWAYS A HUGE AMOUNT OF SAFETY PRECAUTIONS ESPECIALLY WITH THE MAINSTREAM GUY DOING IT ALL, YOU KNOW, WE HAD SAFETY MEETINGS ALL THE TIME. >> AT THE TIME, I DIDN'T REALLY THINK ABOUT HOW HARD IT IS TO BE A FIREFIGHTER. SO THEY HAD ME CARRYING DUMMIES UPSTAIRS. >> I THINK A COUPLE OF PEOPLE STARTED THINKING THEY WERE GONNA PASS OUT RUNNING UP AND DOWN STAIRS WITH ALL THE GEAR ON. >> STEVENS, WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING? >> SHH! >> IF THE CAPTAIN CATCHES YOU, YOUR ASS IS HISTORY. >> I DIDN'T REALLY REALIZE HOW INCREDIBLY REAL THIS WAS GOING TO BE. WHEN YOU'RE HAVING SEX BEHIND FIRE, YOU DON'T REALLY REALIZE THE FEAR THAT YOU'RE GONNA BE FEELING. >> WE REALLY ONLY HAD ONE HUGE FIRE DAY, AND HE HAD A HUGE CREW IN THERE TO MAKE SURE EVERYBODY KNEW WHAT THEY WERE DOING. AND REALLY HAD A GRASP OF WHAT THE ISSUES WERE WHEN IT CAME TO SAFETY AND ANY, UH-- AND KEEPING THE ACTORS OUT OF DANGER. >> I REALLY THINK THAT WE-- WE ACCOMPLISHED SOMETHING REALLY BEAUTIFUL AND SOMETHING >> TO BE HONEST WITH YOU, I DIDN'T EXACTLY INHERIT MY FATHER'S SIN... >> IT WAS NOT A HIGH-BUDGET MOVIE. OVER FIVE DAYS FOR 70 GRAND. SO 2-1/2 DAYS, $35,000... IT'S NOTHING FOR FILM. >> TO ME, IT WAS A BIG DEAL BECAUSE THIS WAS ANOTHER ONE-- YOU KNOW, THE FILMS WERE HERE AND THERE, JUST FEW AND FAR >> DIDN'T YOU APPLY AT THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE IN COUNCIL BLUFFS OR SOMETHING? >> YEAH, I GOT ACCEPTED, TOO, BUT I'M NOT READY TO LEAVE YET. >> THE ACTORS THAT CAME ON REALLY TOOK IT SERIOUSLY AND REALLY, YOU KNOW, I GOT GOOD PEOPLE WITH ACTING CHOPS. SHANNA McCULLOUGH WHO, YOU KNOW, LATER WON AN AWARD FOR IT FOR BEST ACTRESS. >> THIS WAS A FILM NOIR AND IT WAS A DETECTIVE STORY AND HE WANTED ME TO STAR IN IT. IT'S A STORY OF TWO DETECTIVES AND THIS WOMAN WHO'S A FEMME FATALE KILLER. AND SHE'S, YOU KNOW, SEDUCING MEN AND THEN KILLING THEM. AND SHE'S BEEN STALKING MY PARTNER. APPARENTLY, HIS FATHER DEALT WITH THIS ALSO FEMME FATALE IN HIS CAREER AS A POLICEMAN. AND HE THINKS IT'S THE SAME WOMAN AND SHE'S STILL AROUND AFTER 50 YEARS. AND I SAID, \"NO, IT MUST BE HER DAUGHTER.\" >> THE LOOK OF \"LOOKER\" IS VERY GRITTY AND NOIR INSPIRED AND THIS IS NO ACCIDENT. I WANTED TO DO A MOVIE THAT COULD'VE BEEN SHOT IN THE 30s. >> HE WAS A REAL SLAVE DRIVER. HE LITERALLY WOULD WORK A 24-HOUR DAY IF THAT WAS WHAT WAS NECESSARY BECAUSE HE WAS A PERFECTIONIST AND HE WANTED EVERYBODY ELSE TO BE. >> WHEN WE SHOT THAT MOVIE, WE KNEW WE HAD SOMETHING SPECIAL. >> WE PUT A LOT OF HEART INTO IT AND NIC PUT A LOT OF HEART INTO IT, AND WE DIDN'T GET AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT MUCH ANYMORE SO IT REALLY FELT GOOD THAT IT WAS RECOGNIZED FOR WHAT WE REALLY WANTED IT TO BE. >> EARLY ON IN THE SHOW, SHANNA WON FOR BEST ACTRESS. AND WE WERE LOOKING AT EACH OTHER LIKE, \"COULD THIS BE?\" AND THEN JUST THE FLOODGATES JUST OPENED UP AND WE WON BEST FILM DIRECTOR FOR ME, BEST FILM, ART DIRECTION, SCRIPT, EDITING. I MEAN, TRIFECTA, SWEEP. SO IT WAS ONE OF THE BETTER >> DOGS LICK. MEN FUCKING EAT PUSSY. EAT MY PUSSY. >> \"SEVEN DEADLY SINS\" WAS THE OBVIOUS CANDIDATE FOR THE VIGNETTE STYLE OF SHOOTING. I WANTED TO BE ABLE TO HAVE EVERYTHING DISTINCTLY, UH, REPRESENTED BY THE SIN ITSELF. >> WHERE AM I? >> YOU STUPID BITCH. >> THE BASIC STORY IS A CRISIS OF THIS WOMAN WHO'S IN LOVE WITH THE REAL JANINE. AND SHE'S BEEN TOLD THAT SHE ACTUALLY KIND OF LOOKS LIKE JANINE, BUT OF COURSE, WE HAVE A REALLY DOWDY VERSION OF HER. SO THE CHALLENGE WAS HOW DO WE >> IT WAS A STRETCH, YOU KNOW, IT WAS, UH... I WAS JUST KIND OF... IT'S HARD NOT TO JUST EMBRACE HER. SO, UH, TO TAKE MYSELF OUT OF THAT SITUATION AND BE LIKE, \"YEAH, IT'S ME AND IT'S ME,\" >> YOU KNOW, THERE WERE CERTAIN THINGS THAT WE HAD TO HIDE. WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO SHOOT AND BE SOMEBODY, AND YOU CAN'T SHOW YOUR FACE OR YOU'RE TRYING TO IT WASN'T EASY. THAT I CAN TELL YOU. >> YOUR A WHINY, DRIED-UP OLD MAID. >> SHUT UP! >> THAT NOBODY WANTS. >> SHUT UP. >> THERE WAS A LOT OF FOOD. THERE WAS AN ABUNDANCE OF-- (GIGGLING) IT'S A PERFECT SCENE IF YOU'RE A FOOD FETISH KIND OF GUY. >> WE HAD TO BUILD SUPPORTS FOR THESE-- I THINK THEY WERE TEN-FEET TALL-- AND WE DID AN ARC AROUND THAT. AND THEN SET THAT IN A STAGE THAT, AT THE TIME, I THINK WAS BLACK. SO WE COULD, YOU KNOW-- AND THEN WE ACTUALLY GOT A TURNTABLE FOR THEM TO HAVE SEX ON SO THAT COULD REVOLVE, SO THE IMAGE BEHIND IN ALL THE MIRRORS WAS REVOLVING AT THE SAME TIME. IT HAD A VERY, YOU KNOW, KIND OF A SURREAL DEPARTMENT STORE >> HEY, WATCH THE TEETH, SWEETIE. >> SORRY, FORCE OF HABIT. >> \"DARK ANGELS\" CAME OUT-- SCOTT TAYLOR, THE OWNER OF NEW SENSATIONS. HE GOES, \"I'VE ALWAYS REALLY KIND OF LIKED HORROR MOVIES AND STUFF AND VAMPIRE-TYPE STUFF.\" AND I SAID, \"WELL, WE CAN DO >> YOU LOOKING FOR SOMETHING SPECIAL TONIGHT? >> IT DEPENDS, YOU A COP? >> YOU SEE A BADGE, SWEETHEART? >> WHEN I CONCEIVED THE WHOLE STORY AND WAS WRITING THE SCRIPT AND EVERYTHING, MIKE HORNER WAS ALREADY CAST IN MY HEAD. >> WE HAD TO SPEND MORE TIME PREPPING AND SETTING UP FOR THE BLEEDING SCENE THAN WE DID ON THE ENTIRE SEX SCENE, BECAUSE IT TOOK SEVERAL HOURS FOR THEM TO THEY HAD TO CLEAN THE CAR ONE TIME FROM ALL THIS BLOOD-- ALL OVER THE WINDOWS. IT JUST DIDN'T WORK FOR >> I WAS JUST GETTING TO THAT. >> WE DIDN'T GET STARTED DOING THAT SCENE UNTIL ABOUT MIDNIGHT. AND WE WENT TILL LIKE 4:00 IN THE MORNING, 5:00 IN THE MORNING. WE GOT OUT OF THERE JUST IN TIME FOR THE SUNRISE. >> WHEN I APPROACHED SYDNEE TO DO THE MOVIE, I SAID, \"ALL RIGHT, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE DONE SOMETHING LIKE THIS BEFORE, WE'RE GONNA DO, LIKE, YOU KNOW, FULL-BODY CAST OF YOU, PROSTHETICS.\" 'CAUSE THAT'S HER IN THE MONSTER SUIT AT THE END. AND, YOU KNOW, AND YOU'RE GONNA BE WEARING CONTACTS AND ALL THIS. AND, YOU KNOW, WOULD YOU COMMIT TO THIS? >> AND I'M LOOKING AROUND THE WAREHOUSE AND THINKING, \"MAN, YOU KNOW, I'M WORKING IN THIS WAREHOUSE AND, YOU KNOW, I'M A NEVER TOOK THE TIME TO TAKE CARE OF ALL THESE PALLETS THAT LAY HERE ALL OVER, BROKEN.\" \"AH, I'LL NEVER FALL ON THAT.\" IN THE DUMPSTER, WOULDN'T YOU KNOW IT? PALLET, RIGHT, RIGHT? A PALLET AND BROKEN GLASS. >> JEWEL DE'NYLE WAS THE CONTRACT GIRL, AND SHE ACTUALLY QUIT, UH, FIVE DAYS BEFORE WE FINISHED SHOOTING. SHE STORMED OFF THE SET. IT'S ACTUALLY ON THE BEHIND-THE-SCENES. FORTUNATELY, I HAD SHOT THE END ALREADY. IT BROKE A LOT OF RULES WHEN IT CAME OUT. IT UPSET SOME PEOPLE, IT EXCITED A LOT OF PEOPLE, IT MADE A LOT OF MONEY, YOU KNOW? IT WAS-- IT WAS ONE OF THOSE GREAT EXPERIENCES THAT I WAS NEVER ABLE TO DUPLICATE, EVEN WITH BIGGER BUDGETS, BIGGER CREWS, NEWER EQUIPMENT, EVERYTHING. I WAS NEVER ABLE TO CAPTURE THE MAGIC THAT WENT INTO >> YOU TRIED TO GET MY ATTENTION. >> YES. >> WELL, YOU DID. I WAS VERY IMPRESSED BY YOUR DVD. ANYTHING ELSE IMPRESS YOU >> I THOUGHT I HAD A GOOD MOVIE BECAUSE, UH, THE SCRIPT WAS THE BEST SCRIPT THAT I THOUGHT I HAD EVER COME UP WITH IN TERMS OF INTERESTING IDEAS. IT TOOK A LONG TIME TO WRITE IT. (SHRIEKING) >> TO BE DIRECTED BY JOHN, ESPECIALLY FOR THIS MOVIE, WAS SO SPECIAL FOR ME I WAS A BIG FAN OF ALL THE \"BUTTMAN\" SERIES. I WAS A BIG FAN OF JOHN, SO IT WAS LIKE BEING IN A DREAM. >> I HAD A GOOD MEETING WITH MY CINEMATOGRAPHER WHO SAID, \"WELL, WHAT'S THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THOSE TWO GIRLS?\" AND I SAID, \"OH. THEY COULD HAVE A RELATIONSHIP.\" THAT'S MORE THAN JUST THE GIRL IN THE BACK ROOM TRYING TO SEDUCE ROCCO. >> MY ENGLISH AT THAT TIME WAS HORRIBLE, LIKE, BARELY ANY ENGLISH. ROCCO SPEAKS FRENCH VERY WELL SO HE WOULD TRANSLATE SOME OF THE THINGS, BUT THE FUNNIEST PART WAS-- WAS THE DIALOGUE I HAD, I WAS BASICALLY DOING IT-- DOING IT-- PHONETICALLY. >> I TOLD YOU THEY ARE STILL IN THE DARK AGES. I'M ALREADY NOT A GREAT ACTOR TO START WITH, BUT HERE, IT WAS LIKE-- LIKE ROBOTIC ACTING. >> I'LL DO THIS THING ABOUT THIS LITTLE FASHION COMPANY 'CAUSE I WANNA DO STUFF WITH FASHION 'CAUSE I LIKE CLOTHES AND SEXY CLOTHES ON GIRLS. IT GIVES ME AN EXCUSE, AND I'LL HAVE THIS LITTLE MOUSEY GIRL SITTING IN THE CORNER AND SHE'LL JUST-- SHE'LL REALLY BE THE BRAINS BEHIND THE OPERATION. AND WE'LL DO THIS LIKE NORMAL, LIKE TV SHOW KIND OF THING. BUT THAT MORPHED INTO A FETISH FASHION COMPANY AND THE GIRL SITTING IN THE CORNER WAS BELLADONNA WHO SENDS THE GUY SHE'S TRYING TO SEDUCE AN EXTREME S&M DVD WHERE HE FINDS THIS STUFF WITH EASTER EGGS ON THE DVD. IT MORPHED INTO SOMETHING THAT WAS REALLY LIKE A PRIMER FOR S&M SEX. WHEREAS, IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THIS MIDDLE-OF-THE-ROAD THING, BECAUSE I CAN'T THINK MIDDLE-OF-THE-ROAD SOMEHOW. 305 ROLLS OF FILM AS I RECALL. AND MOST OF THOSE WERE THE FOUR MINUTES, ALTHOUGH, WE DID HAVE ON TWO DIFFERENT DAYS, WE HAD THE BIG CAMERA WHICH COULD SHOOT 11 MINUTES AT A TIME WHICH WAS SO GREAT, 11 MINUTES. I DON'T THINK I'VE DONE MY BEST MOVIE YET, THAT'S FOR SURE. I HOPE TO BE DOING MY NEXT MOVIE IS GONNA BE MY BEST MOVIE, >> WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU TODAY? >> I'D LIKE A MASSAGE. >> WELL, YOU'VE CERTAINLY COME TO THE RIGHT PLACE. >> I MADE THE ORIGINAL \"MASSEUSE\" IN ABOUT 1990 OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. AND IT WAS REALLY A DEPARTURE >> HELLO, THIS IS JIM. >> I THINK IT IS THE BEST I FELT SO INCREDIBLY COMFORTABLE WITH THE SCRIPT, >> THE DIRECTNESS, THE SIMPLICITY, THE TRUTHFULNESS OF IT. THERE'S NO BELLS AND WHISTLES. IT'S JUST A MASSEUSE AND HER CLIENT TALKING. YOU KNOW, WHAT DID I CALL IT-- \"MY DINNER WITH ANDRE\" OF X-RATED MOVIES. >> IF YOU WATCH THE MOVIE CLOSELY, YOU CAN ALMOST SEE ME, THE REAL ME, DISCOVERING MYSELF. SO THAT'S WHY I LIKE IT SO MUCH. HOW OLD ARE YOU? >> 28. >> GIRLFRIEND? >> CAN I TELL YOU A SECRET? >> SURE, I LOVE SECRETS. >> I'M A VIRGIN. >> I LIKE TO STAB AND SEE HOW FAR I CAN GO. PAUL THOMAS HAS A WAY ABOUT HIM, AND I THINK I GAINED A LITTLE BIT OF HIS RESPECT. HE'S USED TO BEING ABLE TO TELL PEOPLE POP, POP, POP, POP, POP. AND I WOULD BE LIKE, \"LISTEN, NO, THIS IS THE WAY THIS SHOULD BE, AND THIS IS THE WAY THIS SHOULD BE. WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT?\" >> SHE BROUGHT A LOT TO THE TABLE, SHE LISTENED TO ME, ALWAYS ON TIME-- I'M THE ONE WHO HAD TO STEP UP MY GAME. YOU KNOW, WITH JENNA, NO PARTYING, YOU KNOW? >> I'LL SEE YOU LATER, >> I PLAYED JUSTINE JONES, JONES,\" AND JENNA JAMESON PLAYED THE DEVIL, WHICH WAS QUITE INTERESTING BECAUSE I GOT THE SCRIPT AND THEN HEARD THAT AND MY-- MY FIRST THOUGHT WAS NOT ONLY DO YOU HAVE TO REMAKE THIS AMAZING CLASSIC FILM, \"THE DEVIL AND MISS JONES,\" BUT ALSO NOW NEXT TO JENNA JAMESON >> AT FIRST IT FEELS LIKE A NO-WIN SITUATION, YOU KNOW? WHAT AM I GONNA MAKE ONCE IN A WHILE, YOU GET \"GODFATHER TWO,\" BUT MOST OF THE TIME, THE SEQUEL'S JUST AREN'T SO GOOD IF THE ORIGINAL'S >> I HAD BEEN OUT OF THE BUSINESS FOR A LONG TIME. AND PAUL THOMAS CALLED ME ONE NIGHT AND SAID, \"WE'RE GONNA DO A REMAKE OF 'THE DEVIL AND I SAID, \"WELL, VERY GOOD, PAUL, CONGRATULATIONS, GOOD LUCK,\" AND SO FORTH. AND HE SAYS, \"YOU'RE GONNA BE IN IT,\" AND I SAID, \"OH, NO, I'M NOT.\" AND HE SAID, \"OH, YES, YOU ARE.\" HE SAYS, \"YOU'RE JUST GONNA DO A CAMEO, THREE LINES.\" I SAID, \"I DON'T EVEN WANNA LEARN THREE LINES.\" HE SAYS, \"I'LL GIVE YOU $10,000,\" I SAID, \"OKAY.\" >> WHEN SHE COMES OUT AT THE END OF THAT MOVIE, YOU GET CHILLS. ESPECIALLY IF YOU KNOW WHO SHE IS. IT REALLY WORKS, AND, UH... SHE'S JUST DELIGHTFUL. >> DO YOU READ, MISS JONES? >> ONLY ROMANCE NOVELS, IT'S MY JOB. >> YOU ARE SO PRIVILEGED. AND YOU FEEL SO SORRY FOR YOURSELF. IS ONE OF THE MOST GROUNDBREAKING WOMEN EVER. OWNING HER SEXUALITY AND NOT BACKING DOWN AT THE TIME WHEN SHE WAS FAME-- UBER FAMOUS. I HAVE ULTIMATE RESPECT FOR HER, AND I MADE SURE I TOLD HER THAT. AND HER ACTING WAS FANTASTIC, TOO. >> IT WAS REALLY COOL TO DO THAT BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, AT THE TIME, WE WERE THREE OF THE BIGGEST NAMES IN THE BUSINESS, AND IT WAS LIKE, \"WOW, THIS >> WHILE I'M GETTING DP'D, I SAY THIS MONOLOGUE FROM-- THAT GEORGINA SPELVIN SAID IN THE ORIGINAL \"MISS JONES.\" >> IF YOU TOUCH ME, I'LL COME, I KNOW I WILL. TOUCH ME, TOUCH ME, TOUCH ME. I'LL MAKE YOU COME, TOO. SO WHEN I DID HOWARD STERN, HE SAID, \"WELL, DID YOU FUCK A SNAKE,\" BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE THINK OF THE ORIGINAL MISS JONES. THEY DON'T REMEMBER MUCH, BUT THEY REMEMBER THE SNAKE SCENE. AND WHAT THEY ACTUALLY REMEMBER ABOUT IT, BUT THEY THINK MOSTLY THAT THERE WAS A SEX SCENE WITH A SNAKE. SO I WENT TO VIVID AND I SAID, \"LOOK, WE HAVE TO DO A SNAKE SCENE.\" >> IT WAS A GOOD TIME IN EVERYONE'S LIVES. THEY WERE TIGHT. VIVID WAS TIGHT. WE WERE ALL TIGHT AND WORKING-- REALLY WORKING BOTH FOR \"THE DEVIL IN MISS JONES\" AND FOR \"MASSEUSE\", WORKING AT THE TOP OF OUR PROFESSIONAL LEVELS AND OUR PERSONAL LIVES. WE'RE ALL PRETTY DAMN TOGETHER. SO IT WAS NOTHING BUT-- NOTHING BUT POSITIVE. >> THE 2000s WERE THE DECADE WHEN PORN GREW UP. FLUSH WITH MONEY FROM THE DVD BOOM, PRODUCERS BEGAN SHOOTING BIGGER MOVIES WITH MAJOR BUDGETS, GIGANTIC CASTS, AND ELABORATE SCRIPTS. THESE ADULT BLOCKBUSTERS NEEDED A BETTER FORMAT THAN SIMPLE VIDEO, AND FILM WAS BECOMING TOO COSTLY TO JUSTIFY. COMING WITH ITS OWN SET OF TECHNICAL ISSUES AND CONCERNS, THE FAST-GROWING HD FORMAT >> THE FEATURES OF THAT TIME, WERE PEOPLE SPENDING A LOT OF MONEY ON THEM... >> YEAH. >> WHEN IT WAS NEW, WERE THEY-- >> YEAH, I MEAN, LIKE, FIRST FEATURE LEADS WAS FOR \"WICKED.\" IT WAS THIS REALLY BIG, LIKE, MICHAEL RAVEN MOVIE. I REMEMBER IT HAD, LIKE, THESE OOZING, LIKE, TENTACLE DILDOS AND FOG MACHINE, AND, LIKE, THESE BIG SETS AND IT WAS THE FIRST TIME, YOU KNOW, WE SHOT OUT IN THE DESERT AND IT WAS, LIKE, A WIND STORM AND IT WAS JUST-- IT WAS AWESOME. IT WAS, LIKE, REALLY FUN TO GO FROM, LIKE, JUST GETTING, LIKE, YOU KNOW... >> NAILED. >> FUCK-NAILED ON A GONZO SET, JUST POUNDED, LIKE, \"YEAH, MOTHERFUCKER, COME ON, I CAN TAKE IT,\" YOU KNOW, TO, LIKE, CATERING. (LAUGHING) YOU KNOW, LIKE, \"WOULD YOU LIKE A SNACK?\" \"YES, I WOULD.\" >> THERE'S BREAKFAST ON SET? >> SO HOW HAS INTERNET AFFECTED THE INDUSTRY TODAY? >> I THINK IT MAKES THE FANS ACCESS YOUR FAVORITE STARS AND HAVE CONVERSATIONS AND GIVE THEM GIFTS AND, YOU KNOW, JUST TO TALK TO WHOEVER YOU'RE A FAN OF. SO THE INTERNET, LITERALLY, THEY CAN SEE WHO'S SHOOTING WHEN, THAT DAY, THEY KNOW WHEN IT'S GONNA COME OUT. IT'S JUST, LIKE, RIGHT NOW, >> I'M LOOKING FOR A PIRATE. >> WE KNOW MANY, MANY PIRATES. >> BY FAR, THE BIGGEST PRODUCTION THAT I'VE EVER BEEN INVOLVED IN HAD TO BE THE \"PIRATES.\" SHOT STUFF IN L.A., THEN TOOK THE WHOLE TROOP, CREW, EVERYBODY THAT WAS INVOLVED IN IT ALL THE WAY TO FLORIDA. WE SHOT ON THE U.S.S. BOUNTY. IT TOOK THREE WEEKS TO SHOOT >> HELMSMAN, PREPARE TO SET SAIL. >> ARE YOU REALLY GONNA LET HER GO UNSCATHED, SIR? >> OF COURSE NOT. >> WORKING WITH JOONE, HE HAS A VISION, HE'S AN ARTIST. HE HAS THIS GREAT VISION OF SOMETHING BIGGER >> THERE'S SOME DIRECTORS THAT ACTUALLY GET INVOLVED IN THEIR STUFF, THEY HAVE THE VISION IN THEIR HEAD, AND JOONE IS ONE OF THOSE DIRECTORS. HE ALREADY HAD THE SET IN HIS HEAD AND THEY BUILT IT AND THEY TOOK THEIR TIME TO DO IT AND HE KNEW EXACTLY WHAT HE WANTED. ALREADY HAD THE SHOTS IN HIS HEAD. >> IT'S A BIT SLOW TONIGHT, IT'S AWKWARD. >> LINE UP THE CREW ON THE BOW. BRING ME THE PASSENGERS FROM THE DECK BELOW. AND, SERENA, AS MUCH AS I LOVE YOUR METHODS, DON'T EVEN CONSIDER KILLING >> I DON'T THINK I WAS EVER A CRUEL PIRATE. I'M GONNA HAVE TO WATCH THAT AGAIN... UH, WAS I A CRUEL-- SHE WAS A HORNY PIRATE. I DON'T KNOW IF SHE WAS CRUEL. >> WELL, THERE'S THE VICIOUS LADY I REMEMBER. >> DON'T EVER SECOND-GUESS ME. >> HE BUILT THE TENSION. SO WE WERE, OF COURSE, THE LAST SCENE OF \"PIRATES.\" HE JUST WAITED, AND THEY WOULD SAY LITTLE THINGS TO US TO LIKE GET US READY AND TURNED-ON AND READY TO GO. >> THEY KEPT JESSE JANE AND I SEPARATE, UH, SEPARATED JUST SO THE TENSION AND THE, YOU KNOW, THE ANTICIPATION WOULD BUILD UP AND... >> AND HE'S COME TEASE ME. \"I WONDER WHO'S GONNA WIN? I GUESS SHE'S GONNA SHOW YOU.\" >> SHE'S ABOUT HALF MY SIZE AND THIS LITTLE-- THIS LITTLE CUPCAKE THOUGHT SHE WAS GONNA... DOMINATE ME? I HAD TO-- I HAD TO PUT HER IN HER PLACE, BUT I LET HER PRETEND TO THINK THAT FOR A LITTLE BIT. >> OKAY, SO CARMEN GETS PUT-- CHOKED OFF THE BOAT BY TOMMY GUNN. >> AND THEY WANTED TO DO THIS STUNT WHERE, UH, STUNT GIRL GOES OFF IN THE WATER, NO BIG DEAL. >> AND SHE GOES, \"NO.\" >> WELL, JESSE WOULDN'T HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT. SHE WANTED TO DO THE STUNT HERSELF. >> AND OF COURSE, I'M A DAREDEVIL, SO I'M LIKE, \"I'LL DO IT.\" >> AND I KNOW WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN BEFORE IT EVEN HAPPENS. SO I ALREADY GOT MY STUFF OFF, GOT MY BOOTS OFF, AND I'M JUST STANDING HERE AND JUST WAITING FOR HER TO JUMP IN. AS SOON AS SHE JUMP IN AND THEY GOT THE SHOT AND THE SPLASH, I'M IN THE WATER AFTER HER. THEY'RE NOT EVEN THINKING THAT THIS BIG, BALLOONING DRESS IS JUST GONNA SUCK UP RIGHT TO HER, AND SHE'S NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO KICK, SHE'S NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO DO ANYTHING. >> WELL, MY DRESS, HER DRESS, GETS CAUGHT ON A NAIL UNDERNEATH THE BOAT AND I START SINKING AND I CAN'T COME UP. >> BUT SHE WENT IN AND SHE ALMOST DROWNED. >> I THINK SOME OF THAT WAS BEHIND-THE-SCENES, NOT ALL OF IT WHERE I WAS DROWNING, 'CAUSE THAT WAS PROBABLY NOT GOOD. I DEFINITELY DIDN'T KNOW IT WOULD BE AS BIG AS IT WAS AND THE NUMBER ONE MOVIE EVER. AND PEOPLE WHO EVER WATCHED PORN HEARD OF THE MOVIE AND WENT TO WATCH IT. IT WAS THE FIRST MOVIE TO BE CUT INTO A RATED R VERSION AND RENTED IN BLOCKBUSTER. IT WAS A BLOCKBUSTER HIT. >> YOU MUST THINK ME A MONSTER. >> \"CORRUPTION\" WAS PROBABLY THE FIRST BIG-BUDGET MOVIE I WAS THAT INVOLVED IN. I'D, YOU KNOW, BEEN IN OTHER BIG-BUDGET MOVIES AS TALENT, BUT YOU'RE NOT AS INVOLVED YOU SHOW UP AND, YOU KNOW, YOU PRETTY MUCH DO YOUR THING >> IT WAS SOMETHING BEING DONE AND BEING DONE WELL AND WITH, LIKE, HEART. THAT, LIKE, ATTRACTS ME. YEAH, I GOT YOU RIGHT WHERE YOU WANT ME. >> I ALSO HAD A PRETTY DECENT ACTING ROLE. AND THAT WAS PLAYING THE PART OF CAROLYN HELMS, WHO WAS THE SENATOR'S WIFE. AND SHE'S KIND OF THE CENTRAL PART OF THE MOVIE. HERE'S CAROLYN IN THE MIDDLE, AND SHE'S KIND OF STARTS MANIPULATING EVERYBODY >> I'M A UNION LEADER, A TEAMSTER. AND I'M A-- I'M TRYING TO WORK, TO GAIN AN ADVANTAGE. WORD IS YOU'RE PLANNING A RUN AT THE BIG TICKET IN TWO YEARS. IF THAT'S TRUE, YOU'RE GONNA NEED MONEY, US, AND GOD ON YOUR SIDE... IN THAT ORDER. I'M BEING BLACKMAILED IN THIS SCENE, SO I'M-- SO I'M DOING-- I'M PERFORMING A SEXUAL ACT THAT IF I GET CAUGHT, MY OWN CAREER WOULD BE DONE. SO I WAS-- IT WAS ANOTHER SCENE OF HUMILIATION FOR ME, WHICH I'M COMFORTABLE WITH IN MY OWN LIFE WITH TWO MARRIAGES BEHIND ME. >> HOW MANY TIMES DID THEY PUSH ME OUT OF THE CAR? HOW MANY TIMES DID THEY ALMOST HIT ME WITH THE CAR? >> I THINK THEY WERE JUST HAVING FUN THROWING JAMES OUT OF A CAR. >> I HAD TO BE LIKE LIMP AND GET THROWN OF THIS CAR, UM, ONTO A PILE OF GARBAGE. >> I THINK THEY MUST'VE SHOT THAT SCENE. FOR WHATEVER REASON, LIKE 15 TIMES. >> IT FELT LIKE FOREVER 'CAUSE I'D BEEN PUSHED OUT OF THE CAR IN TO GARBAGE. AND THEN THERE WAS THIS ONE TIME WHERE, UH, MY LEGS FELT A LITTLE WEIRD AND, LIKE, EVERYONE STARTED SCREAMING 'CAUSE THE CAR ALMOST ROLLED OVER MY ANKLE. >> IT WAS FUN, IT WAS FANTASTIC BECAUSE WE'D ALL WORKED SO HARD ON IT AND, YOU KNOW, WE HAD THIS SENSE OF FAMILY AND HARD WORK, AND THE MOVIE JUST LOOKED INCREDIBLE. AND THEN WE WON. AND I REMEMBER JUMPING UP WHEN WE WON AT THE AVN AWARDS AND I HAD A CORSET ON AND I WAS SO EXCITED AND I ACTUALLY PEED >> WOW. THAT WAS THE CLOSEST THING TO GOD I'VE EVER FELT. >> I DON'T KNOW, BUT IT'S... IT'S A LOT BIGGER AND A LOT IT WAS MY FIRST LEAD, BIG FEATURE FILM LIKE THAT. I HAD DONE THE SMALLER ONES WHERE I WAS LIKE SUPPORTING ACTRESS. BUT THIS WAS LIKE-- IT REALLY PUT ME ON THE MAP AS FAR MY PARTNER DIES, LIKE, IN THE LINE OF DUTY. I'M DEVASTATED. BUT I'M KIND OF LIKE A HARD-ASS, TOO, AND I DON'T LET ANYBODY KIND OF SEE MY EMOTIONS. AND WE DISCOVER THIS HACKER GIRL, WHICH WAS PLAYED BY HILLARY SCOTT. AT THAT POINT, SEXY PICTURES HAD JUST SIGNED HILLARY TO UNDER CONTRACT. AND THEY TOLD US WE HAD TO USE HER. IN THE END, HILLARY DID AN AMAZING JOB. SHE ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW... SHE WAS PREPARED AND SHE CAME AND WHO AM I KIDDING? SHE DID NOT WORK HARD AT ALL. SHE DIDN'T, I'M LYING TO TRY THROUGH THE MIRACLE OF EDITING AND GOOD ACTING COACHING, I THINK THAT SHE FILLED THE ROLE FINE. >> DAVID, I KNOW YOU CAN HEAR ME. >> SHOWED UP ON SET AND I WAS LIKE, \"OH, THIS IS A BIG MOVIE, AND THEY'RE LIKE, \"YEAH, YOU'RE LIKE THE STAR OF IT.\" I'M LIKE, \"BUT I'M ONLY HERE FOR A DAY.\" AND THEY'RE LIKE, \"WELL, ALL RIGHT, YOU'RE NOT THE STAR OF IT, YOU'RE JUST-- THE WHOLE >> YOU SEE A LOT OF MOVIES IN PORN WHERE THEY SAY, \"WE SPEND A MILLION DOLLARS, WE SPEND $2 MILLION,\" WHATEVER THE CASE IS. AND I'M GOING TO TELL YOU THAT FOR THE MOST PART, THEY LIE. PEOPLE WILL SAY, \"WE SPEND ALL THIS MONEY,\" AND THEY USUALLY DOUBLE THE AMOUNT. NOW LET ME TELL YOU, \"UPLOAD\" COST $350,000. THAT'S AN UNHEARD OF AMOUNT OF MONEY IN PORN. WE SHOT FOR 20 DAYS. I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER KNOWN A PORN MOVIE THAT SHOT FOR 20 DAYS. >> WHEN \"UPLOAD\" WON ALL THE AWARDS, PICKED UP PRETTY MUCH ALMOST EVERYTHING UNDER THE SUN AT AVN'S, I FELT LIKE SUCH A STRONG FEELING OF ACCOMPLISHMENT. >> ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I LEARNED FROM ELI CROSS IS HE SAID, \"THERE'S TWO THINGS YOU NEED, YOU NEED MONEY AND TIME. AND THOSE TWO THINGS WILL ALWAYS HELP YOU WITH A BETTER MOVIE.\" WE WERE ABLE TO TAKE THE MONEY THAT WE HAD AND TURN IT INTO TIME, AND THAT MADE FOR A BETTER MOVIE. >> WHATEVER YOU ASK... I AM YOUR SERVANT. \"FALLEN\" TO THIS DAY IS IN \"FALLEN\" I AM A GUARDIAN ANGEL AND MY CHARGE IS JENNA HAZE. (EXPLOSION) >> NO! I THEN LOSE MY WINGS, AND I'M SORT OF ROAMING THE EARTH IN LIMBO IF YOU WILL. AND I PRETTY MUCH HAVE SEX WITH EVERYONE IN MY PATH. >> THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS. WHEN YOU'RE IN THAT FANTASY REALM, ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE AND A LOVE STORY AT THAT WITH ALL THIS FANTASY STUFF WITH ANGELS AND FLYING AROUND ON ROOFTOPS, IS CAN YOU ACTUALLY >> OH! OH! >> A LOT HAS CHANGED. I'M NO LONGER AN ANGEL. \"FALLEN\", I THINK WE SHOT IT OVER TWO WEEKS, BUT IT WASN'T EVERY DAY OF THOSE TWO WEEKS. WE HAD PREP DAYS AND THEN WE HAD DOWN DAYS, SO-- SO PEOPLE COULD REST THEIR PARTS, YOU KNOW? WE HAD A LOT OF REALLY AMAZING PEOPLE IN IT. IT HAD ACTING, IT HAD A REALLY GREAT STORYLINE. IT HAD A LOT OF SEX. IT HAD A LOT OF HARDER SEX, TOO. >> A LOT OF \"FALLEN\" TAKES PLACE ON ROOFTOPS, AND THOSE ARE ACTUALLY IN CAMERA. I'M-- I'M SCARED OF GREEN SCREEN MYSELF. I THINK \"FALLEN\" STANDS ON ITS OWN MERITS. IT'S A GREAT STORY. IT KIND OF PROPELLED JESSICA INTO THAT SUPERSTAR STATUS. AND, UH, DIDN'T DO BAD FOR ME AS A DIRECTOR, AS WELL. THE REAL REASON TO DO \"FALLEN\" WAS TO KIND OF HAVE JESSICA HIT THAT OTHER LEVEL. AND IT'S GREAT IF YOU CAN PUT HER IN THIS GREAT MOVIE. BUT IF THE SEX FALTERS, THEN IT'S JUST A GREAT MOVIE AND, YOU KNOW, YOU HAVEN'T DONE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO WITH YOUR STARLET BY TAKING HER >> WHAT HAPPENED? >> NO ONE KNOWS FOR SURE. THEY CALL IT THE BIG BURN. AND ON THE EIGHTH DAY, >> WHEN I THINK OF A POST-APOCALYPTIC WORLD, UH, IT'S MORE THAN JUST BROKEN DOWN BUILDINGS. THERE'S A PRIMAL ELEMENT TO IT WHERE PEOPLE ARE STEALING FROM EACH OTHER IN MORE WAYS THAN ONE, AND LIFE BECOMES CHEAPER BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH >> MY CHARACTER WAS BASICALLY BEING SEX TRAFFICKED IN POST-APOCALYPTIC, UH-- I DON'T THINK IT WAS ACTUALLY I MEAN, JUST POST-APOCALYPTIC EARTH. >> YOU A BUTCHER NOW, TOO? >> SPECIAL COMMISSION FOR THE PRINCE. HE GETS FIRST LOOK AT ALL MY TRADE. >> \"THE 8TH DAY\" WAS CONCEIVED BY ME WITH AMBER RAYNE IN MIND AS THE LEAD CHARACTER. SHE IS THE SCRUFFY TANK GIRL IN THE WHOLE MOVIE. BUT IT WAS PERCEIVED BY EVERYONE THAT KAYDEN, BEING ADAM & EVE'S CONTRACT GIRL, WAS THE STAR OF THE SHOW. AND SHE CERTAINLY WAS THE BOX COVER, BUT SHE IS THE SUPPORTING ACTRESS. AND, UM, WHEN AWARDS TIME CAME OUT, IT WAS THE OTHER WAY AROUND. AMBER GOT SUPPORTING ACTRESS NOMINEE AND KAYDEN GET, YOU KNOW, ACTRESS NOMINEE. >> \"THE 8TH DAY\" WAS PROBABLY THE HARDEST MOVIE I'VE EVER WORKED ON. THERE WERE SOME DAYS WHERE WE HAD STARTED THE DAY BEFORE. THERE WERE EXAMPLES IN THE MOVIE OF, UM, LIKE A MARKETPLACE, LIKE A BAZAAR THAT WE HAD TO BUILD WHERE PEOPLE WERE HAWKING JUNK OR THEY WERE HAWKING FOOD OR CLOTHES, THINGS THAT THEY'D SCAVENGED. >> THAT WAS A HUGE UNDERTAKING AS FAR AS ART DIRECTION WAS CONCERNED. THE ART DIRECTOR, KYLIE IRELAND, SPENT WEEKS RUNNING AROUND L.A. FINDING STUFF TO DO THERE. MY FAVORITE KAYDEN MOMENT, UM, IN THE WHOLE SHOW WAS WHEN SHE'S SUPPOSED TO BREAK DOWN AND CRY ABOUT HER DAD. >> IT WAS BEFORE I LEARNED HOW TO CRY BY MYSELF. >> AND CAN'T GET ANY TEARS TO FLOW AT ALL. WE WAITED A GOOD LONG TIME, AT LEAST A HALF AN HOUR. I WALK BACK IN AND I SAID, \"YOU GOT NOTHING?\" SHE GOES, \"NO, NOTHING BAD'S EVER HAPPENED TO ME.\" >> I THINK THEY SQUIRTED CITRUS JUICE OR SOME SORT OF CITRUSY FRUIT IN MY EYES TO MAKE IT GO. >> SHE SAID, \"HOLY SHIT, LET'S SHOOT RIGHT NOW 'CAUSE GOD DAMN IT, THIS BURNS.\" AND I SAID, \"PERFECT.\" >> MY DAD DID THIS. (CRYING) ALL OF THIS. >> AND SHE GOES, \"WHY DID YOU DO THAT TO ME?\" I SAID, \"FUCK YOU, YOUR LIFE'S PERFECT.\" NO WONDER YOU CAN'T CRY. >> IT WAS ONE OF THOSE THINGS AFTER THE BLOOD, SWEAT, AND TEARS THAT WENT INTO IT, IT WAS REALLY A NICE PAYOFF. IT WAS NICE TO BE ABLE TO SAY SOMEONE ACKNOWLEDGED THIS. IT WASN'T JUST US, YOU KNOW, FUCKING AROUND IN THE DESERT. 'CAUSE THERE WERE TIMES WHEN IT >> HOW DID MY FATHER DIE? >> A YOUNG JEDI NAMED DARTH VADER, WHO WAS A PUPIL OF MINE, OFF AND LEFT HIM BURNING IN A RIVER OF LAVA. >> \"STAR WARS\" IS PROBABLY THE AND THERE'S SO MUCH TO PARODY IN IT, SO, UM... WE REALLY DID-- WE REALLY DID, THAT COULD BE HAD, EVERYTHING SINGLE REFERENCE THAT WE COULD HAVE, AND RECREATING A LOT OF THE SCENES. IT WAS REALLY A LOT OF FUN. IT'S A LOT OF WORK, BUT WE HAD A LOT OF FUN. >> SHOOT FIRST, SHOOT OFTEN. SORRY FOR THE MESS. HAD TO KNOW \"STAR WARS\" TO ONE, GET THE HUMOR. TRYING TO GO WITH IT AND WHAT WAS HAPPENING WITH STILL KIND OF TRYING TO STICK TO THE ORIGINAL SCRIPT. >> THE THING THAT ALL THE FANS WOULD ASK ME IN THE BEGINNING WHEN I ANNOUNCE THE MOVIES, LIKE, OKAY, THERE'S ONLY ONE GIRL IN \"STAR WARS.\" YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A PORN MOVIE-- TO THIS DAY, PEOPLE WRITE ON YOUTUBE, THEY WATCH, YOU KNOW, THEY READ ABOUT IT LIKE THERE'S GONNA BE ONLY ONE GIRL? IT'S NOT TRUE, WE FOUND OTHER GIRLS THAT ARE PART OF THE \"STAR WARS\" UNIVERSE. THE GIRLS IN THE CANTEEN, I MEAN, THERE'S-- THERE'S A TON OF PEOPLE THAT WE WERE ABLE TO PUT TOGETHER, IT'S WAS REALLY INTERESTING. >> YOU CAN FIND SEX IN ANYTHING. I DON'T NECESSARILY THINK THAT, YOU KNOW, THE MOVIE OR THE THEME HAS TO BE SEXY TO MAKE IT SEXY. THAT'S OUR JOB, THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE. WE'RE SUPPOSED TO MAKE THE THINGS THAT AREN'T SEXY SEXY. >> DON'T ACT SO SURPRISED, YOUR HIGHNESS. >> I'M NOT SURPRISED. I'M DISGUSTED. WE SAT IN A ROOM AND HE TALKED INTO A POT. WE RECORDED ALL HIS SOUND IN A GIANT POT, LIKE A SPAGHETTI POT. IT WAS HILARIOUS. >> EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE I HAVE A GOOD IDEA. AND IN \"STAR WARS\" IT WAS LIKE CHI CHI LARUE. >> I'M SAVED! OVER HERE. HEY, SAILOR! >> C-3PO HAS ALWAYS BEEN VERY METROSEXUAL, AND I FIGURE WE TAKE IT, YOU KNOW, TO PARODY THAT, TO EXPLORE THAT. >> \"STAR WARS\" WON A TOTAL OF EIGHT AWARDS AT AVN WHICH IS THE MOST THAT ANY PARODY HAS EVER WON, AND I THINK THAT'S AMAZING. IT'S CRAZY, UM, AND WHAT'S EVEN MORE AMAZING ABOUT THAT IS MOST OF ALL THAT-- ALL THE WORK FOR THE MOVIE WAS DONE BEHIND-THE-SCENES, WITHOUT THE SETS, WITHOUT THE COSTUMES, WITHOUT THE TIME AND DEDICATION FOR THE SCRIPT. THE SHOOTING, THE ANGLES, THE GREEN SCREEN, THE POST PRODUCTION. THE MOVIE WOULD'VE BEEN NOTHING. AND I THINK, UM, YOU KNOW, THAT REALLY SHOWS AND, YOU KNOW, BY WINNING EIGHT AVN AWARDS, IT DEFINITELY SHOWS THAT OTHER PEOPLE APPRECIATE ALL THE HARD >> MOST KNOW ME AS DEATH. >> WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME? >> I'VE COME FOR YOU. >> THE BASIS BEHIND \"UNDERWORLD--\" I PLAY A CHARACTER NAMED TANYA, AND I HAVE BEEN WITH MY FIANCÉ AND WE HAVE MADE THE SWEET LOVE, TO DRIVE ME HOME, WE'RE IN HIS PARKING GARAGE, AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, WE'RE VICTIMS OF A VIOLENT MUGGING. >> SAY GOOD-BYE TO YOUR BOYFRIEND. >> NO, PLEASE! >> THE OPENING IS, UH, A BIT DRASTIC AND A BIT BLOODY AND VIOLENT, UH, BUT WE ACTUALLY WENT BACK AND FORTH ON HOW VIOLENT TO MAKE IT. >> AND THEY'RE TRYING TO SAVE MY LIFE, I'M PUT UNDER ANESTHESIA. AND WHEN I GO UNDER ANESTHESIA, THE REST OF THE MOVIE IS THAT, GOING BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN ME FIGHTING FOR MY LIFE IN THE OPERATING ROOM AND THE THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING TO ME IN THE UNDERWORLD. >> IF YOU REALLY WATCH THE MOVIE, EVERYTHING PRETTY MUCH IS-- HAS A MIRROR IMAGE WITH THE PEOPLE IN THE OPERATING ROOM AND THE UNDERWORLD BELOW. EVERYTHING'S KIND OF TIED IN AND EVERYTHING'S, UH, GOT A YING AND A YANG SORT OF THING. >> XANDER CORVUS PLAYS SLICE AND HE WAS SORT OF, UH, HE HAD SCALPEL FINGERS AND HE WAS UP ON STILTS AND SO HE WAS THE SCALPEL THAT WAS STARTING THE SURGERY. >> THIS JOURNEY THAT YOU'VE EMBARKED UPON IS YOUR SUBCONSCIOUS SELF REACTING TO THE WORLD AROUND IT. >> THE NURSE WAS PASSING THE GAUZE TO THE DOCTOR. DURING MY OPERATION IT FELL. AND AS IT DROPPED, YOU SEE AN AERIALIST FALL OUT OF THE SKY >> SO ME AND JESSICA DRAKE GOT TO HAVE SEX ON WATER, OR IT LOOKED AS THOUGH IT WAS DIRECTLY ON THE WATER, BUT IT WAS WAS BUILT AND, UH, THERE WAS MAYBE LIKE AN INCH OF WATER ON TOP OF IT. >> AND I'M BLOODY IN A SHALLOW POOL OF WATER FOR LIKE EIGHT HOURS THAT DAY. >> WHEN THE INTIMIDATION MELTED AWAY WAS WHEN SHE STUMBLED ON A FEW OF HER LINES AND LAUGHED AT HERSELF. AND THEN YOU REALIZE, LIKE, SOMEONE'S A HUMAN BEING, AND THEY'RE A NORMAL PERSON AND... THAT'S OKAY. >> OH, I LOVE HAVING SEX WITH ASA AKIRA. RIGHT BEFORE THE SCENE, WE'RE TAKING PRETTY GIRLS AND I'M LIKE, \"OH, THIS IS GONNA BE REALLY FUN.\" WE JUST SORT OF GOT ON EACH OTHER AND ROLLED OFF THE SET. WE DID IT EVERYWHERE. LIKE, WE WERE JUST HAVING SEX, SO, AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE, YEAH, I WOULD LIKE TO, UH, >> IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE YOU WANT? >> I MEAN, WHAT ELSE IS THERE APART FROM LUXURY? >> THAT CAN'T BE A SERIOUS QUESTION. >> AN INDIE PORNO, THAT'S WHAT WE CALL IT. IT'S-- IT'S LIKE A REAL MOVIE WITH EMOTION AND ACTING IT'S PORN WITH A REAL STORYLINE. >> WHY DID YOU COME? >> I CAN'T DO THIS AGAIN. >> WHY DID YOU COME AFTER FIVE FUCKING YEARS? MY CHARACTER, HER NAME'S JACKY. SHE'S THE BADASS. SHE'S DEFINITELY THE BADASS OF THE MOVIE AND SHE, UH, IS TRYING TO OPEN THE OTHER LILY UP TO THIS WORLD >> MY ROLE IN \"WASTELAND\" WAS VERY SIMPLE. THERE'S TWO GIRLS AT THE BAR. I SAY SOMETHING IN THEIR EARS WHICH IS EASY FOR ME. TAKE HER UP TO THE BATHROOM AND HAVE SEX WITH LILY LABEAU IN THE BATHROOM. IT'S A VERY, VERY CLOSED ENVIRONMENT, IT'S LITERALLY REAL TOILET SO THERE WAS NO ROOM TO OPEN THE DOOR, SHOOT, LIKE, THROUGH THE OPEN DOOR. THEY SHOT IT ALL FROM ABOVE. I THINK HE KNEW THAT THE BEST WAY TO USE ME IS NOT TO HAVE ME SPEAK BUT LET ME JUST FUCK. >> I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE BIGGEST THINGS THAT SEPARATES \"WASTELAND\" FROM A LOT OF THE OTHER PORN IS THAT THE SHOTS ARE SO BEAUTIFUL AND THEY ARE THOUGHT OUT. EVERY SINGLE SHOT IS THOUGHT OUT AND PLANNED TO JUST-- >> IT WAS REALLY, REALLY DARK, UM, WHERE WE SHOT THAT SCENE, FOR ME BECAUSE I'VE NEVER SHOT ANYTHING IN SUCH DARK LIGHTING. IT WAS JUST COMPLETELY DARK. I WAS LIKE, \"REALLY, LIKE, CAN YOU GUYS REALLY SEE WHAT WE'RE SHOOTING?\" THEY'RE LIKE, \"YEAH, YEAH, IT LOOKS COOL.\" >> IT'S THIS WHOLE STORY COMBINING TO MAKE THIS BEAUTIFUL JUDGMENT HAD REARED ITS UGLY HEAD. AND RIGHT WHEN MY GUARD WAS FULLY DOWN, IT SUDDENLY HAD POPPED BACK UP. >> EMMA GOES INTO INTERVIEW A MAN BY THE NAME OF WILLIAM FITZGERALD WHO IS THIS VERY PROMINENT BUSINESSMAN WHO EMPLOYS PREDOMINANTLY FEMALES. THERE'S AN UNSPOKEN ATTRACTION PROPOSITIONS HER FOR THE ROLE OF BEING HIS SUB. SHE'S NOT A VERY SEXUAL PERSON. SHE DEFINITELY DOESN'T CONFORM TO NORMAL SOCIETY'S VIEWS >> I DIDN'T READ THE \"50 SHADES OF GREY\" BOOK OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT BECAUSE I REMEMBER JACKY WE WANNA DO PRETTY MUCH THE OPPOSITE OF THAT. >> I READ \"50 SHADES OF GREY\" AND I HATED HOW THE FEMALE PROTAGONIST WAS PORTRAYED. SHE WAS INCREDIBLY WEAK AND HER ENTIRE MOTIVATION WAS TO PLEASE A MAN AND TO MAKE A MAN HAPPY. I WANTED TO SET ABOUT WRITING A BDSM STORY THAT REALLY EXPLORED A STRONG WOMAN'S SUB ROLE AND HOW THAT CAN BE SO EMPOWERING FOR HER. >> SHE WAS, UM, LIVING, LIKE, A KIND OF RESERVED LIFE AND NOT REALLY BEING HERSELF, AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I CAN VERY MUCH RELATE TO BECAUSE I ALWAYS WANTED TO JUST, LIKE, BE THE PERSON THAT EVERYONE WANTED ME TO BE. >> BDSM IS NOT JUST BEATING SOMEBODY AND HARMING SOMEBODY AND PHYSICALLY HURTING THEM. IT'S SO MUCH ABOUT THE MENTAL ASPECT OF THOSE RELATIONSHIPS. SO FOR ME, I WANTED TO TELL A STORY ABOUT THAT. >> I DID FEEL LIKE, UH, I HAD A LITTLE BIT OF AN ADVANTAGE JOINING THE MOVIE BECAUSE I HAD SOME BDSM EXPERIENCE WORKING WITH DIFFERENT BONDAGE COMPANIES IN THE INDUSTRY. SO IT WAS NICE TO BE ABLE TO BRING IN A LITTLE BIT OF MY KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCE WITH THAT FOR A MOVIE THAT SO MUCH, LIKE, REVOLVES AROUND THE BDSM COMMUNITY. >> SO \"THE SUBMISSION OF EMMA MARX\" WON BEST BDSM MOVIE AT AVN. AND I WAS COMPLETELY FLOORED BECAUSE WE'RE UP AGAINST BDSM COMPANIES. AND NEW SENSATIONS MAINLY IS A FEATURE GONZO STUDIO THAT DOESN'T REALLY FOCUS ON ANYTHING PARTICULARLY HARDCORE. >> I WAS REALLY FLATTERED THAT THEY WOULD RECOGNIZE THAT FILM, ESPECIALLY GIVEN THAT IT WASN'T REALLY THE PHYSICALITY THAT WAS EXPLORED. IT WAS THE MENTAL ASPECT. >> WHEN I FIRST STARTED, WE WERE DOING FILM, IT WAS A THRILL. IT WAS GREAT, YOU KNOW, WE'RE LUGGING THESE BIG ASS CAMERAS AROUND SAN FRANCISCO AND HAVING A FIELD DAY. NOBODY BOTHERED US, NOBODY CARED, YOU JUST DID THE MOVIES. AND THE DRUGS WERE GREAT. AND VIDEO CAME OUT AND IT WAS-- IT WAS A SMALLER PARTY. YOU DIDN'T NEED THE CREW YOU HAD FOR 35 MILLIMETER. YOU HAD WAY SMALLER CREW, AND YOU WOULD JUST SORT OF LOAD IT IN A VAN, SHOW UP AT A LOCATION, SHOT YOUR FOUR OR FIVE SCENES AND RAN OUT THE DOOR, YOU WERE DONE. AND THE DRUGS WERE OKAY. AND-- AND TOWARD THE END, IT REALLY JUST GOT, \"HOW FAST CAN YOU CRANK IT OUT AND GET IT BACK TO ME AND I GOTTA PEDAL IT...\" AND THE DRUGS SUCKED. >> IT'S HARD TO SAY WHERE THE PORN INDUSTRY WILL GO FROM HERE. THE INTERNET ERA SEEMS TO DEMAND A RETURN TO THE LOOPS AND VIGNETTES THAT GAVE BIRTH TO THE EROTIC FILM IN THE FIRST PLACE. IT'S A SHAME TO THINK THAT THIS LIST OF THE GREATEST ADULT MOVIES MAYBE THE LAST OF ITS KIND. BUT THE FUTURE IS HARD TO SEE. AND MAYBE THE ADULT FEATURE WILL SURPRISE US WITH ITS LONGEVITY. I'M CHANEL PRESTON, GOOD NIGHT. ♪♪ >> IF THE BRILLIANT SWEDISH FILMMAKER INGMAR BERGMAN EVER MADE AN X-RATED MOTION PICTURE, IT WOULD LOOK EXACTLY LIKE THIS. >> \"PRISONER OF PARADISE\" STARS SUCH FILM GREATS AS SEKA.

Trust has brought Hou Ma Enterprise to where it's today tell the engineering department to finish on time. Sure. What other appointments do I have? You'd meet Executive Councilor Mr. Jones at three, and the Manager of Schick Bank would like to ask you to join him for golf at five. I turned him down for you, because Mr. Jones would like to invite you to a fashion show tonight. Director Huang of Po Leung Kuk wants to speak to you. Do I need to entertain them? I guess it would help. Very well, pass the line. Director Huang? There isn't any problem about the donation. Certainly, I'll donate five hundred thousand. You're too kind. It's the least I could do for the kids. Alright... take care, bye. What's your problem? The show's about to start. Why are you so late? Time is running out! Stop it! Step on the gas. I waited almost an hour for you. I know. That's why I was late. You're doing this on purpose? You don't need to pick me up, I could always get a cab. Fine, next time you drive. You know better that I don't have a car, there's no need to be so sarcastic. You just need to nod and there are many who'd gladly give you their cars. Too bad I can only say no. How's that possible? Yours. For me? What now? Just a favour. I did my share to get you where you are in the modeling world. Yes you helped me, but I don't really owe you anything. Come on! We're friends here. Just tell me what's on your mind. Open it. It's fancy. That means it's not from you. I can't afford it. A rich man did. Spend some time with him, as if you're with me. A Patek Philippe watch with 24 diamonds, I wouldn't give such a gift to my wife no matter how much she begs. Very well, tell your wife to sleep with him then. Hey! You broke it. My wife wouldn't go. Thank goodness. You wanna kill yourself? Dam n. Sorry. Have you eaten? Not yet. Take it. And you? - I've eaten. - Alright. Is my eye-shadow alright? Put a little bit more on this side. Oops, where's the other pad? I put it here a while ago. Where is it? I need it now, who took it? How can I go out without it? Put a papaya inside. Then she'll be bigger than yours. Better than no figure. Let me see. Go to hell! Village bike. You're yelling at me? You're nuts! You took my pad as an ashtray? And you call me nuts? What's that got to do with me? I didn't know who put it here. Bitch with a big mouth! And you've a big ass, why don't you go sell your ass? Look at her! How could she? That means everyone could have a ride. Whoever calls me a village bike again, I'll rough her up. Village bike. You. Tina isn't here yet? She's on her way. What's the matter with her? We only have ten minutes before the show, why isn't she here? Chill out, Stella. She's a top model. What? Top model? If she pisses me off, I wouldn't hire her again. No wonder everyone says you're a fair boss. Stella, this doesn't fit me. Then try out Tina's. Sorry, Stella. I'm late. Don't worry, still have ten minutes. You're experienced, shouldn't be a problem. Put some makeup on. Forget it, Mary. Wear it in the next show. She should be an actress. Why are you so late? Bad luck, I bumped into a pimp. Mr. Ho? Yes. Don't you know how Stella is? She talked behind your back. Well, I'm used to it. Mr. Ma, welcome. Over there. Mr. Luo. Hello... Mr. Ma, Chairman Lin has been waiting for you. Hello, Mr. Jones. Mr. Ma, it's nice to see you. Mr. Li, you're here so early? You know I'm a fan of fashion shows. Enjoy the show, excuse me. Simon, how come you're so late? Got held up by the Light Rail project in Tuen Mun; The worst is, I don't know what the Government blueprint is like, I daren't buy off those houses there for development. When you have become a Councilor, then you'd know everything. But there's no news regarding that so far. I've set it all up, that's why he'd like to meet you. If there's anything else I could do, please tell him to let me know. Stella. Yes? Is Tina here? She's changing. You know how snotty she is! So? He said you're qualified, the council has recommended you, all we need is the Governor's signature. The Governor asked them the other day why you're still not married. In order to have a political career, it's better if you're married. I'm pissed when I see her face. Calm down, I'll help you out. It's better if you're married. Hurry»- Who hid my shoes? Look! She's doing this on purpose. Don't worry, we'll get even. Zhen, so you hid my shoes. It's not my problem, Shark told me to keep them. Why are you so mean? You told Zhen to hide my shoes? What is it to you? You get changed faster than Rosa. Rosa? Yes, she used to be a top model. Famous for changing clothes quickly. I've heard. But she's no longer a top model. She was so full of herself, she even ignored Mr. Ho. It's all over for her. Young people are like that. What's wrong with some social gatherings? Just communications! You can't say that. I'm here as a model, not some hooker. So? Chairman Lin, do you see anyone you like? Let me take a good look. You like the black or the white? Neither, introduce to Mr. Ma. What do you think, Mr. Ma? Pick one. There's no need, I want her. Very well, I'll set it up. That bitch was trying to knock me off the ramp. You know they're friends. So? Bite me. I really wanted to kick her off the catwalk. Forget it! We're doing proper shows. Fine! I'll have my chance. Tina, Mr. Ma would like you to join him for dinner. I'm tired. Mr. Ma is a successful businessman. In that case, pass it to Shark. He wants to date me? In your dreams. So, Tina? Refuse again? That's right. I think we have some misunderstandings, let's have a good chat. We have nothing to talk about. That's exactly why we should talk. Sorry, I need to go eat with Mr. Ma. He's taking you out? You don't have the caliber. Can't even lie, what's the point with the act? If he's asked you on a date, what are you doing here? It's not that difficult to be sitting in a Rolls Royce. Follow my lead and earn as much as you can while you're still young. Very well, if you don't believe me I could go with you, but you need to explain to him. Go. Mr. Ma. Where's Tina? Sorry, she twisted her ankle. So? I'd rather piss off Mr. Ma, but I won't dare to offend you. Very well. You think you're really something, huh? Careful! When you fall I'll be there to laugh at you. Go buy some clothes. Thanks, I'll set up another date tomorrow. That's fine, she's here. Tina. Mr. Ma. So? How's your ankle? She's fine now... hop in. Mr. Ma, you're so charismatic. Stella, I told you to set it up, I didn't invite you. No... I wanted to bring you here. This is really formal. This is a fund raising party for the International Foundation for the Physically Challenged. The Governor will be here soon. Chairman Ma, hello. You've brought a date. What's the occasion? Come on, let's have a chat. Please. Enjoy yourself. Hello. What a party! Tina, what a surprise! You look beautiful, let's sit over there. Alright. Who's she? Chairman Ma's girlfriend. I think she's a model. Sit down, what a lovely shawl. Thanks. I'm surprised that Chairman Ma brought you. I haven't seen him with a date in public. You flatter me Miss, any drink? Mint liqueur Thanks. Guess he must like you a lot. Why did you bring me here? It has a good view. I'm afraid that I've climbed too high. Shall we get married? Sorry? Shall we get married? Married? Sure. I'm busy tomorrow, how about the day after? I'll ask Mr. Jones to be our witness. Sure. Come pick me up in a bridal car then. Ok. Miss Bai. I wonder if you're interested to be Mrs. Ma. Are you serious, Simon? The bridal car is waiting. This is your size, put it on. Come look. What? They gave you a chamber pot Must be from Peter. We'll make tea for him with it when he's over. Good idea. What's this? What's this? Chastity belt. Yuck. Your friends all gave you really strange presents. What a lovely necklace. Look. You're entitled for something better than pearls, I'll give you a diamond necklace one day. Really? You're Mrs. Ma from now on. You should be prepared. I know, there will be lots of socializing. TV shows, speeches, ribbon cuttings, even representing me on the board's meetings. Then I will be super busy? That's why I'd like to ask you a question, hope you won't mind. Of course not, we're a married couple. What's your sex drive like? Strong, average or low. Average. I think, sex is only a part of married life. Good, I'm glad you think that. I'm not particularly keen on sex, but intensely passionate towards other things. Meaning? As Mrs. Ma, you can have anything you want, except sex life. You'd still be very happy, get it? You'll get used to it. Good night. You're not dressed yet? I'm not feeling well. It's a very important party. The Governor will be there, you must go. Put on some make up, go on. Wear this one, it's more graceful. Mrs. Ma, the new stock hasn't arrived yet. That's fine, I just want to buy that dress I saw last time. Sure. Is this the one, Mrs. Ma? Yes. But Mrs. Chen, Miss Liang and Mrs. Zhou all bought one, would you mind? Of course not, I just need to put this in my wardrobe. Okay. Right. Any other colours in the fur coat I bought last time? It comes in four more colours. I'll take one of each. Hmm, something to match Mr. Ma's jacket every time Just a moment. Sure. How much? Five thousand two hundred. So expensive. It's worth every penny. You sure can pick. It's a gift from you, I must pick what I truly like. Helen, Anna. Tina, what a surprise! I'm bored, that's why I come shopping. If you're bored, get pregnant. That's right. Is it pretty? Yes. Let me try them on. I'm a size 7, do you have that size? This is size 6 and a half, try it on. It might fit. Anna's gift. Why? It's her birthday? No, she introduced me a boyfriend, I'm giving her a gift. Who? It's that fat guy. I'm going to Europe with him tomorrow. Look at him. I've noticed him couldn't stop staring at you since you walked this way. Can't be. Find someone who loves you and marry him. That's easy to say, but difficult when it comes to reality. Is this ok? I'll take it, pack it up. Right away. Hey, it's been a while. Why do you look so terrible? An imbalance of the yin and the yang? She's married, How's that possible? Your husband can't get it up? Come on, it's just lack of sleep because of socializing How have you been? Walking around like a headless chicken. What do you think? Looks great. 4,420 dollars Didn't you say $5,200? Mrs. Ma is our VIP, she has a 15% discount. Anna, you've saved eight hundred dollars. Pay UP- I don't have so much cash. Tell the fat guy to pay. Ok. Hey, Anna's asked you to settle the bill. Who's that? She's pretty. Feasting eyes on next dish before finishing the first can you handle it? Pay UP! I'll get back my money's worth. You tell Anna in Europe. Eighteen thousand seven hundred in total. Mrs. Ma. One each. Thanks... The fat guy is busy tonight, why not join us for a fun night out? Sure. Oh, I can't. My husband is hosting a dinner tonight. Dam n. You don't care about us anymore. That's right. Sorry, when Anna returns from Europe, we'll get together again. Really? Thanks, Mrs. Ma. Rosa, is it? So full of herself Did you say that? Stella did. Boss Ho can't destroy me, just like you; you seem to do pretty well, too. It doesn't matter if I can't be a model, look at me, I'm better off now. Women are strong. Are you tired? Let me give you a massage. You have great skin, it feels good. You do this quite well, do you massage others or get a massage? I like both. I own this place, do come often. What was that? Relax. You can't always have good days. When you've grown old, forget about me serving you then. You knew that I've guests tonight, why are you home so late? I'm sorry, I fell asleep in the sauna. Forget it, go get changed! Simon, come here. I've good news. What news? We had a meeting, Mr. Jones mentioned about you joining the Legco. Thanks. Simon, the Governor knows that you're married. But don't worry, tomorrow we'll sign the documents. That shouldn't be any problem, you can trust me. You'll get your confirmation by the end of next month. Congratulations! Thanks for your support. We've all wanted you to join. Where's Mr. Ma? He's going out. Mrs. Ma, what time do you want to eat? I don't want to eat. So? Not asleep yet? Can't sleep, I'm waiting for you. It's okay You know it's the last thing on my mind, go to bed. Lady My license was revoked for speeding in another country, but still it wasn't as reckless as you. If you'd like a race, pick a date, and I need a different car. Sorry, I'm not interested to race you. There's a telegram from the HQ in Singapore. The boss has ordered to hold the Ma Computers stocks from going public. Ignore him, I'm in charge here. I could do whatever I wish. Mr. Ma, what's bothering you lately? Is it because of her? Why don't you let her run a small business? Would it work? Better than nothing to do. Has the fat guy contacted you since you' re back? I'm glad that he hasn't. You don't get along with him? Of course not. How come? The first night in Europe, he brought two black guys in the hotel. I thought... oh no! It turned out that he was banging the black guys. He's gay? I had no idea. It's sick, don't bring it up again. Then why did he ask me to look for you? He's bisexual. Are you here to play? Coming... You play with her first, she's no match for me. Alright. Tina. Why do you look upset every time I see you? Is that so? She gets materialistic fulfillment, but not emotional; of course she isn't happy. Why don't you do some business? My husband suggested the same thing. But I'm not sure what. Modeling agency. But one needs production support for that. If you have money, that shouldn't be a problem. I've a friend who's a stage director, he just came back from France. You mean Sam? Yes. Great, introduce them. Sure. Hey Sam. I'd like you to meet my friend. Sam, this is Tina. It's you! So you know each other. If that's the case, we wouldn't have argued. Sam, Tina needs your help on something. Sure. Remember to attend the class next Monday. Sure, bye. Is Helen here? Regarding what? Mr. Ho introduced me to be a receptionist here. It's me, you're Nancy? Yes. He spoke to me yesterday, fill in the application form first. I'll tell them to re-do these, don't worry. I almost crashed into you the other night. Sorry. You still remember? No entertaining tonight? I turned them down, I wanted to eat with you. A toast to your business Let's hope your company will grow bigger than mine. Thanks... for someone who didn't show up at the opening I'm making it up to you. Tina What is it? Nothing. Why are you crying? Didn't expect you being so nice to me. Really? Maybe now I've just realised that I've a great family, a good wife. I met with the Governor yesterday and he talked to me about the councilor, there will be an announcement soon. No wonder you're so happy. I want you to be happy too. Hello. Mr. Ma, I'm Zhichao. What is it? The tender for Wharf Holdings' land closes tomorrow. You still haven't decided on the price. What do you think, Mr. Ma? Mr. Ma, hello? Who is it? Mr. Ho is waiting for you. It's urgent. It will take a while. Will you give me a massage? It's so one way, you don't know how to enjoy. You know? It's better to give a massage than getting one. In that case, I ought to massage you. Try. Just think why men are so keen on night club hostesses, and you'll understand. Oh please! Which part of you hasn't been touched by a man? My heart. No man has ever touched my heart. Don't you have a boyfriend? Yes, they left on the space shuttle, all rubbish. What kind of a man do you prefer? Mr. Zhao, he really knows how to enjoy women. How did you know? You hooked up with him? No, l just want to be like him. Who's this? Hold on. Tina, your call. Hello, Zhichao. Business so soon? Do it well. That boss is a friend of mine. You must pay special attention, that's all. There's no need to let her know I'm the boss, I don't want her to rely on me. Sure. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, B, 7, 8... another leg... Tina, this is a close replica of the Indian Kohinoor. We need to return it after the show. It's pretty, look. Very pretty. You're so sweaty. You've had a tough day, let's go out for a dance. Thanks. You've found a good helper. Thanks. From now on, no more business. Just enjoy the evening. Look at her. Konbanwa Come on. Where's the phone? Over there. Hello Your husband hasn't left you, is it? Or else Why'd you be playing Madame Butterfly here! I don't want to talk about him, I'm so bored. All he does is entertain others, he ignores me at night. It doesn't make any difference if I'm married or not. What? He ignores you at night? You can sue him for ill treatment Has he ill-treated you? I don't know. Can't be. If it's like that, how can he be a councilor? True. I know you won't believe me, but he really ignores me. I must have a good time tonight. Fine! We'll have fun. Guess who loses, guess who loses... Drink up... Look at you! You don't look like a celebrity wife. You are worse than night club hostesses. Aren't you fond of them? I was just trying to learn from them. Shut up. You had a good time with the two women earlier? How come you're home so early? You can't get it up again? What are you talking about? I just want to know what's your sex drive like? Strong, average or low. I get it... You've strong sex drive when it comes to the bar chicks but low sex drive when facing your wife. Why aren't you looking at me? Am I not pretty? Don't I have a good figure? Have a good look! Feel it! Why don't you dare? Can't believe I am not better than those women! Cheap whore! Yes, I'm cheap. Wouldn't have married you otherwise. You're worse. You wouldn't marry me if you're not cheap. You hit me? You whore! I know what you need, come on. Let go! Just act like her! Come on! Take a closer look. Why aren't you paying attention? Is this what you like to watch? Watch away! Why aren't you watching? Go! Go! Go! Tom my! I'll give you another thousand, Ben. Stay calm. You can't raise the stakes now. Says who? Bravo! Tommy seems to be doing better than Ben. I don't think so, I think Ben will win. Mrs. Tan, where did you take him last night? Shut up! You brat! Where did you take him? Way to go, Tommy! Way to go, Tommy! Tom my, you're great. Well done! It's all yours. Okay. I'm impressed, Tommy. Keep me company tonight. I'm tired. What's the big deal? I'll get Ben to go with me. I'll take you out, Tommy. I've earned enough. Big deal. He's a gigolo. I'll introduce you if you're interested. Tell him to join me for a drink. Sure. You could take that attitude? I have to if I don't want to remain poor. It's one way or the other. You would do anything for money? I wouldn't do a thing if you don't pay enough. It's noisy here. I know a quiet place, would you like to join me? You need these? Who's doing the beating? Doesn't matter, but the charges are different. I need to pay you to beat me up? It's all about the technique. I won't charge you if you beat me. Let me give you a massage. I've had many clients, but you've the best skin of all. Do you go to the bars often? How come I haven't seen you before? You talk too much. You're the best client I've had so far. Yours. Thanks, Mrs. Ma. Remember, I'm not Mrs. Ma. Miss X. I hope to serve you again. Call me anytime. You won't see me again. Be more sexy. Sit on it, the side. Stand together, face me, good. Hands on waist. Bend. No, not like that. Hand, here. Put your feet closer. You're too fat to be a model. She said I could. I said you could learn, didn't say you could work as one. Then what's the point for me? At least you could learn something. I quit, I want a refund. There's no refund after you've taken the course. I don't care. Refund! Don't run! Give my money back. What's going on? I can't work on someone so awful. I'll do it. Zhichao, you're still here. Yes. Where's Simon? In the study. Don't you need to go to the nightclub with Mr. Jones, why are you still here? Leaving right now. Tina. Not busy today? Since the three top models have left, I've lots of free time. Come on. There are so many fashion shows in Hong Kong, we can't take all the jobs. Right. I've taken on a big show, and would like you to help me with it. What about me? Certainly. How do you want me to help? You know that there are only a handful of good modeling agencies in Hong Kong. I want to borrow your girls for the show, and I'll give you a commission afterwards. No problem. It's time! Get your make up on! To our partnership. Anna, go and teach them how to put on make up. Sure. Helen Stella has a show and would like to hire our models, arrange it. Just contact me. The boss is treating us to dinner tonight, I'd like to bring a few models along, to let him have faith in the show, alright? Sorry. We're a modeling agency, not a brothel. We're in the same line of work. You've knocked on the wrong door. If you want some girls to entertain your boss, you can call up the escorts service. So? Got turned down? Boss Ho. Why didn't you let me know if I can make some money? You have connections? Of course. I'm in charge of Tina's models. Hop in. Sure. Stella, look at these. What are you doing? Taking pictures of you. Haven't you taken enough? No. You look different in different settings. I want to capture your charisma. You surely know how to please a woman. I meant it. I liked you from the first time I saw you, I didn't even know your name. I'm working with you on this show just because I want to be near you. Don't be silly, I've a husband. I don't care. I love you just the same. Or you'd prefer me to say \"I love you\"? You're crazy! Stop kidding around! I'm serious! It can't be, I've a good family, a husband who loves me, it's impossible. If he loves you so much, why doesn't he spend the holidays with you? If you're so happy, what are you doing here in the middle of the night? Stop kidding yourself. You've a husband, money and status, but he doesn't love you. You' re talking crap. I'm not. You have nothing, except me. Nothing can stop me from loving you. What are you doing? Why are you here? Why can't I come in? You're not allowed in without my permission hereafter. Come on, I'm your wife. I know. I need you to play the good wife in public. What do you take me for? A vase? Some antique? I'm a person! You can ask for a divorce if you don't need me. I've made it clear from the start you can have anything you want, except sex life. But you can't divorce me. I'll look for other men if I can't get a divorce. I'm going to Singapore for a meeting, I won't be back until a week later. You have plenty of chance to look for guys. But I warn you; I'm someone with status. I won't let you get away if you're in some kind of scandal. Who's this? Who's this? Why leave since you're here? Why are you here at this hour? Waiting for you; I knew you'd be back. I don't like men who lie. You want the truth? I jerk off ogling at your photographs. You're sick. Let go of me! What are you doing? Stop! No. Don't! Let go! Don't! Are you tired? Let me give you a massage. No, thanks. I'm busy today. Take care, bye. Hi. You must be tired, let me give you a massage. No, I'm busy today. You enjoy yourself. No! No! Why are you avoiding me? Why won't you look at me? You think you're that special? Morning... ls Tina around? Thanks. Thanks. Finished so soon? It's better when I'm inspired. The fashion designs are all ready, go pick the material You can do it, I need to pick some music. There's a rehearsal later. Let's have dinner. Sure. Bye. Nancy, were you looking for me? Oh, you were right. If Mr. Ma finds out, I wonder what will happen. Stop it. I told them to do it. What do you want? Nothing, just want a word with you. Go on. My boss bought a wife; If you so much like to spend time with her, my boss could buy you too. Tell your boss that, if he tries to buy me, he'd be in trouble. Tell him to keep the money for his coffin. I want to leave town after the ShOW'S over. Why? It doesn't suit me here. Why not? The city is full of energy. Anyway, the population here isn't much. People come and go in the hustle & bustle oi central Tsim Sha Tsui and Mung Kok. They are all monsters. To me, they are all money-printing machines. Some make coins, some print notes. But the funny thing is, they don't know what they're doing. All I want is for everything to stay the same always. Interesting. It's more like pathetic. People here don't have a life. Lifeless folks. They thought they know how to enjoy, but they haven't enjoyed life. Tina, come with me. We're going to have a good life. You think Mrs. Ma and Mr. Li can have a good life? You can divorce him. He married me so that he could show the world that he is a family man. He can't be a councilor if he's divorced, he'd rather die. Think it over. After the show, you will board the flight with me. Qiang, who's she? The new maid. Where's Maria? She got fired by Mr. Ma. Why? She found an earring in the study, Mr. Ma said she moved his stuff without permission. Where's Mr. Ma? He's playing golf, isn't back yet. I told you to mind your own business. Why are you so stupid? Do you feel better now that you've found out? You're not human! I won't stay with you anymore. You want to leave me? Maybe on the day you die. I know you want to torture me till that day. You want to feel better? Let me tell you Today onwards just pretend you don't know anything; don't interfere with my life. Then you're still Mrs. Ma, of the upper crust. I'd rather be a hooker. You don't deserve to be a hooker. You think I don't know your secret? I am just too smart to lay it out. Sam. Tina, what is it? Tell me. I'll leave with you after the show. I knew it. Hurry! It's time for the rehearsal. Helen, these are the copies, distribute them. Sure. Don't worry. You'll know in the rehearsal. Hurry. Why isn't Sam here yet? He said he'd be back by ten. But he's still not here. Call him. Helen, play the music. Let them practise. Sure. The line is constantly engaged. Is the phone out of order? Remember, there are four columns around here. Strike a pose here. Come on. Anna, you come out from here. OK, turn, lower the arm. Helen, you take care of things here. I'll look for Sam. Alright. Hello? Speaking. Great. I'll transfer the money to you right away. Remember, we will never meet again. Sure, good luck. Sam... What happened, Sam? Who did this? Sam... Mrs. Ma, what are you doing here? One of my staff died. What post was he at? Mrs. Ma, what's his name? Is it a murder? That I'm not sure. But something happened at home. If you want to report, follow me. I've a very interesting tape to show you. So? Go with her. Come on. Mrs. Ma told us to come in. Let them in. Mrs. Ma... What's the tape about? Call over more reporters here. I'll have a press conference in the study. Mr. Ma and Mr. Ho in the room, nobody else in. The main characters of the scandal are both here. You can take more pictures later. Follow me. Come on. So it's you! Stop! Get out! This is what a celebrity's true self is. No pictures! Get out! Get out! No pictures! I'll call the police if you don't leave. Get out! This sure is big news. Never mind her.

This is the menu for the wedding dinner Event schedule Please take a look here These are the rooms for the wedding guests We'll do everything you request As for fees I guess you need the deposit? Yes Thank you Have all the other resort guests moved out? Of course Take a look at these people around us Once I receive the money, I'm going to chase them all off the island Thank you A guest has booked the whole hotel So we're moving to the new staff dormitories We have staff dormitories here? Let me tell you I'm very good to my staff Sleep in this tent? Isn't this blissful? Most people sleep in the sea! I know you're a fan of sleepwalking Careful you don't sleepwalk into the sea How do you know? Did I sleepwalk last night? Let me warn you first They are my important guests Don't you scare them away Hey I'll be right there Useless piece of garbage Boss, he's indeed a big cheat I've already gotten hold of his business data I'll return tomorrow Good But Mr. JK wants you to stay behind And get all the data from before July 28 Yes, I understand, Boss Hubby Shall I go over to your room? Didn't you say we needed to sleep in separate rooms before the wedding? You're not smoking are you? No... I was just getting ready for a shower I... Wait a minute An improvement, at least no crash this time Hey Hey Get up. If I said she was sleepwalking Would you believe it? Ah! So I guess that girl in the nightclub was sleepwalking too? I promise I was only entertaining clients that time If I don't work hard with my clients, how do I earn money for us? Fine. Next time just take care of your work and not me When have I not cared about you? Everytime I tell you I want to keep a pet cat, have you cared? Didn't I say keep one if you want? When did I ever stop you? How do I keep one? Everyone's so busy now Then just get a cat next time How long do I have to wait? When I'm an old lady? Everytime I reply to your question, you're not satisfied. What exactly do you want? I want to discuss my problems with you Am I not discussing your problems with you now? Do you think you're talking to thin air? Everytime I talk to you I always feel like you don't care about me If that were the case, would I be discussing a cat at midnight? I feel like I'm just talking to your shell I can't feel your soul Why don't you tell me what you mean by not feeling my soul? If you love me, of course I'd feel your soul That's bizarre Where are you going? Running away as usual My soul's here But I'm taking this shell of mine to bed Please go ahead and converse with my soul No wonder my father didn't want me to marry you Your father wouldn't let you marry me? He said you were completely unsuitable for me He really said that? Really Your father's really wise And all these years To think I've underestimated him all these years I want to cancel the wedding It's you who said it And you're my witness You weird girl I already told you not to sleepwalk into my guests' rooms You sleepwalked into my male guest's room Why didn't you sleepwalk into Chicken's room instead? Which room is Chicken in? How in the world would I know? Let me tell you This is my big client I spent so much effort on them Now all this money I was going to earn Is gone! I want you to get out of my sight now Wait a minute and listen to me We can find a way to reunite them Reunite, wow, reunite You really think it's like the Fisherman Uncle sand sculpture? \"Take a photo here, click click!\" \"Put a photo under your pillow for just 7 weeks, 43 days\" You think it really works like that? 49 days Who cares how many days? Get lost by tomorrow Unless you have a great idea on how to reunite them You can get out of here now I want to sleep Mr. Haochang Listen to me Actually, come to think of it You're about to get married Don't give it up because of a small misunderstanding This misunderstanding helped me realize My wanting to marry Haochang Is a real mistake Women, you see What they want is For you to care for them a bit more Once you do, there won't be any problem at all How else can I care more? Take work for example Everytime she's unhappy at the office, I always tell her to just quit If he really cared for me He'd listen to my complaints Right? He shouldn't always evade the issue And just tell me to quit Us men We have great pressure at work Huge When we're under pressure, can't we watch a game and unwind? What's wrong with that? He's just obsessed with watching games That's very normal Everytime he has problems at work I show him so much concern I spend all night analyzing his problem and provide suggestions You know what I can't stand? I can't stand that She always forces her suggestions on me Be this way, be that way. Do this, do that. I feel She simply doesn't trust my abilities Exactly, I totally agree. Men are the worst because They don't know how to treasure what they have Right, you're so correct What's most important to a man? Face Face, exactly. Face And what's worst about women? They always want to change us men Without face, we have no honor Cheers! Pretending to care about you at the beginning But then later Once they have you, They just start going through the motions Make you feel meaningless And worthless! Absolutely right! Just like some instant noodles they've finished eating Dumped straight into the trash Dumped anytime they like Although they keep saying they don't mind That's all lies! My good friend, you're so right! At the beginning They act like some lovely thing Promising to never leave you But with time, they become vicious harpies! Exactly They're horrifying like that Men... Men! Cry, my brothers! Ain't no crime in crying! Us women, we just need to live like we want to All those jerks who don't appreciate us Will live to regret it! Go ahead and cry! Business is ruined. I'm done for Keeping a cat She can't even take care of herself, and now she wants a cat If a woman has a guy for company, what does she need a cat for? So, by wanting to keep a cat She's hinting that you're not keeping her company enough Why doesn't she tell me directly that she wants me to care more? Of course she won't ask so directly How unromantic would that be? You think it's like your boss sending you a memo? So... Women like using hints and metaphors! They like to use ambiguous... ways of communicating with you If you're really her soul mate You'd completely understand her hints Women are simply troublesome Go find a man if you think women are so troublesome Miss Sophia Not sure if you remember But you said you wanted to book our resort for 2 weeks So I rejected all other guest bookings for those 2 weeks You said you wanted a wedding hall on the sea And I provided you with Southeast Asia's most beautiful most unique floating wedding hall Don't you think it's a pity? What's it got to do with me that you rejected other guests? Running any business comes with risk Don't you understand this basic philosophy? In any case I came here because you told me there was a floating wedding hall You're sharp Of course I am No wonder men don't like you What did you just say? I meant, such a sharp woman as yourself Is surely irresistible to men But sometimes playing a bit dumb Will help make you more lovable Am I right? Tell me again, what exactly do men want? What exactly do women want? Give me an example of what you don't understand I'll analyze for you Well She often tells me that I'm Annoying When I ask her what's annoying about me, she never says She sometimes claims that I bully her Why in the world would I bully her? I'm a man after all Men Iove face So women need to give men face Men are simple creatures They don't like complicated issues If you want to keep a cat Just tell him directly that you want a cat Right? She says you're annoying But you're not at all annoying She thinks you're the most lovable person on earth She says you bully her My dear, you think women are so easy to bully? She only lets people she likes bully her! What's more You're the only person in the world she'll allow to bully her Actually What you think your partner cares most about is Actually what you yourself care most about Yeah? So in the past when I thought he placed work over me Actually It was I that placed work over him When I was sick, he'd always stay by my side Even though he can't take spicy food He'd eat spicy food with me Is it because I didn't work hard enough to understand her? She really is very special to me I guess I really do quite miss him I quite miss her Good news! - Haochang says he misses her! - Sophia says she misses him! - They just need an opportunity to talk - We'll give them that opportunity! Yeah! We'll organize a big meal for them... for free! For free? No, Xiami, we can't do it for free! All these years Whether it was for love or work You've given a lot It's been tough on you Actually I've been adding to your troubles Sometimes You can be just a little bit troublesome But actually A beautiful and occasionally troublesome woman is the most lovable kind Why not We get married? Time to get to work then Cheers! Put it on or not? Is it okay not to put it on? It feels uncomfortable when it's on I'm not responsible if anything happens because it's not on So you're responsible if it's on? Of course Okay Put it on properly And you'll be safe Yup I'll put it on too This way, even if you take to the skies or climb over mountains Even if you go feed the sharks in the sea, I'll know Good night! Are you any good at drawing? Better than you! Prove it Hey Time to get back to work Well said You're becoming as hardworking as me! Otherwise we'll never finish painting this Yeah It's a wrap You look beautiful today! Thank you! - Congratulations - Thank you You're so beautiful Makes me want to get married too! You can hurry up and try! You're so cool You're still sleeping? Even if you set off now, you won't make it Who's going to be the witness at the wedding now? I'm so sorry The witness is on his way He's stuck in traffic... boat traffic Boat traffic? Uh, it's Monday Everyone's rushing to get to work It's you? Sorry for the wait... yes, I was always going to be the witness True moneygrubber... you even want to make money like this Ladies and Gentlemen Welcome to Love You You Resort Thank you for attending... the wedding of Miss Sophia and Mr. Haochang To share in this joyous occasion Shakespeare once said We'll lose even the most beautiful things one day We'll rouse from even the most beautiful dream one day Even our most beloved person will depart one day Even our most beautiful memories will fade one day If you abandon something, never regret it If you don't treasure someone, it's better to part ways What are you talking about? This is our wedding day! You can't be friends after parting ways, because you'll hurt each other Neither can you be enemies, because you were once lovers And so that's how life goes and how your marriage goes Mr. Haochang Are you brave enough To go out on a limb In taking Miss Sophia as your wife? I do Dear Miss Sophia Mr. Haochang's taking a big risk Are you willing to marry him? To be Or not to be? You do? Or not to do? I do Say it to him I do You may kiss the bride Congratulations to the newlyweds on bravely taking the plunge This is a wonderful beginning, thank you! Please put your hands together for the new couple! Boss, we're having problems in the kitchen Excuse me. Thank you Cheers! This is the most amazing wedding I've ever seen Well, you're my most unforgettable guest Alright! Everyone This next song... I wish I could Sing this to her for the rest of my life I'll sing this to her forever \"Love you you\" \"Love's like a wordless book\" \"It can't express\" \"The warmth of love\" \"I wish to give you happiness\" \"But you're guarded\" \"At this turning point\" \"All that's left is a wasteland of broken waves\" \"Love you you\" \"I lost my way in the sea\" \"I cannot find. Where my heart belongs\" Why did you run out? You think my food tastes bad? Not at all That song... it's a little sad So I left A little sad? In that case, I have something that will cheer you up It's beautiful Does this beautiful dessert have a name? Name? A dessert is just a dessert. Why would it need a name? It reminds me of the sea Why not call it Heart of the Sea? Heart of the Sea? Where's the heart? Is there a heart in there? It's like how you can't get to a woman's heart right away That makes sense Heart of the Sea... Not bad... I'm going to charge you a copyright fee! No way! You're beginning to think business like me more and more Of course! How about I cook for you instead? Okay! Actually you're a pretty good cook Why not be a chef? Instead of spending your time getting into fights? Even though I wanted to be a chef Mother made the choice for me to work in the family's hotel business One day my grandfather announced That his grandsons would each run an island resort for 6 months The one with the best results would take over the family business My brother uses unscrupulous ways So every punch I throw Is to protect my dream Of giving my mother a better life Lele Now that your father is gone Mother is left with only you If you don't work hard... in the family business Many bad people will bully me Mother, I promise to provide you with a good life when I grow up Good morning, boss I have a question to ask you Are JK and You Lele brothers? Are they involved in a competition to take over the family business? Xiami, don't bother so much about these things Complete your assignment and come home right away Boss! Where the world were you?

Please reply quickly Call my new number 012269265 Bye Miss Xiami Seems like you and the scoundrel are getting along Scoundrel? He's your brother! Same father, different mothers. Let's be clear about that I find it strange You'd rather help a scoundrel than help me Because I'm a scoundrel too So I won't be helping you anymore You already have 1 bowl of peanuts, 2 ice waters What relationship do you have with my brother? How would I have known he was your brother? I'm asking you a question What relationship? You're nuts A woman just wants her man to be more tolerant Tolerant? If I weren't tolerant, I would have flipped a table already! If this table weren't nailed to the ground! Xiami, actually This guy got all worked up over you This shows he cares a lot for you Cares? He cares too much. I don't need it. How come both of you are so good at giving advice to others but not to yourselves? You've done such a great job helping us How come you're unable to communicate with each other? Wear this in case you sleepwalk into Chicken's room Otherwise I'm not responsible. Regards, Love you you Goodnight! And to think he said he'd be responsible You Lele! So you have 2 passports Miss Xia Don't you owe me an explanation? I don't owe anyone anything I'll leave In fact, I'll leave tomorrow Mr. Lele These are the dates for Miss Nana's stay and a confidentiality agreement Take a look If there are no problems, please sign your name Of course Here's the deposit for 40,000 ringgit It says 60,000 on this check Come over here...

I'll take off first - Hope we have a good time working together - Great Chicken Thank you for all you've done this year I know you've been working really hard lately And you're getting married soon Whether or not I win the competition I'll help take care of your wedding and honeymoon expenses Start work! Everyone has been working hard over the past 6 months Today we'll announce the results of the competition Youpei, 620,000 JK You Jiekai, 920,000 Youmin, 750,000 And You Lele... ...with 950,000 Therefore the winner is You Lele Wait a moment Sorry to interrupt But is this competition fair? Of course What if someone has broken the rules? Then he's disqualified Ok 2 days ago Lele pretended that his boat stalled And used that excuse to come to my island He even got his friend to snoop in my office To try and steal my business records JK, it's Curly here About Nana wanting to book your resort Is the 60,000 ringgit price okay? Please reply quickly Call my new number Count me unlucky But Xiami heard Curly's whole message And here I have a receipt for 40,000 ringgit It proves that Xiami gave the information to You Lele And the very next day... He stole my customer Curly is very honorable and is willing to be my witness It's true You Lele told me he was willing accept a price of 40,000 And even gave me a 20,000 ringgit kickback This bank statement proves it Here, inspect it And I have another important witness Mr. Chicken My boss did tell me to pretend that the boat stalled And to use this as an excuse to steer the boat to Mr. JK's island He then told Miss Xiami to steal information from the office You bastard No wonder you told me the boat ran out of oil It's really unfortunate That we have a scoundrel in our family Then again it's understandable Like mother, like son What did you just say? Insult me if you dare, but leave my mother out of this Look! What a scoundrel! Son, sit down! - Sit down! - Mom! Mother, I did nothing wrong. I've been framed! You must believe me Of course I do. You've already done your best To me, it's been more than enough Since Lele played foul I officially deem him disqualified Good Sorry I didn't win Son, having you by my side is enough for me Sir I can prove You Lele's innocence Did I hear that right? You're a thief trying to prove another thief's innocence? (Disabilily: Deafnece (Severe Degree)) You have severe degree of deafness? I only have 30 percent hearing ability in my left ear So if I don't wear a hearing aid, I can't hear anything at all I can only read lips and observe people's expressions What did you say? That you're... Deaf? You expect me to believe some random medical certificate? We'll never believe you! Enough! Sir, that video footage we saw has not been authenticated Miss Xiami, I'm sorry. We wronged you Listen up everyone. The winner of this competition Is You Lele! Son! - Congratulations, brother - Thank you Your hearing problems have worsened If not for your deceased mother I wouldn't have taken you in Are you listening to music? Let me take a listen - What music is it? - I hear nothing That's not a music player It's a hearing aid - She can't hear - Hearing Aid - Don't bully her - She can't hear What are you doing here? I brought you some food I've told you... not to wear that hearing aid when my mother can see I may not mind, but my mother minds What's the point in going on like this? Let's break up Xiami! Hey! Why do you shout at me from behind? You know very well that I can't hear Now you know why I'm always wearing headphones Because I hate having people shout at me from behind I just wanted to say thank you No thanks necessary. You deserved to win Let me explain I'm sorry. I didn't mean to investigate you You didn't do it on purpose but you never trusted me Do you know that When you hate someone Your right foot always fidgets I never thought this would happen to me You've never believed me I didn't know my foot did that You're very surprised that I know that, right? Ever since I stopped wearing a hearing aid I pushed myself to study everyone's expression closely To study lip reading I wanted to pretend I was a normal person And keep my deafness a secret I know, I know that... You know that? What do you know? You really think I'm that strong? You think it's that easy pretending to be a normal person? That simple? Sometimes I'm so tired of trying that I don't have the will to live Listen to me You can stop pretending I can be at your side. I can protect you I can... I can help you do a lot of things I won't mind at all What right do you have to mind or not to mind? Why? Because I'm not a normal person, right? You know what? If I could go on pretending I'd rather pretend my whole life than hear the words you just said Xiami, can you please not leave? Can you please be brave for once... for me. Just once Brave? Are you brave? You don't even dare fulfill your dream of being a chef That's why you hide out in the family business Because you fear you won't have an excuse if you fail What right do you have to tell me I should be brave? Miss Xiami! Miss Xiami! What are you doing here? When I was copying Lele's computer files that day I accidentally copied his journal I hope that you'll have a change of heart after reading it It's the only chance I have to make up for what I did I'm begging you Hurry up! This JK is always sending thugs to make trouble Scaring away my guests This battle is getting harder to fight Since someone wants to pay me to play a pirate Fine, I'll play one Heck, for money, I'd be happy to play a turtle Some people say When true love appears Time stands still Hey, what's in my line of sight? Turns out it's a shoe Why does she never reply When I call out to her from behind? So strange I suspect she is... Today, I want to confirm my suspicion I chewed gum and pretended to be talking to Xiami To think she really thought I was talking Turns out... you really can't hear You've been reading lips all along At that moment, I wanted to hug her And ask: how you suffered all these years Do you ever break out in song when you get frustrated? Have you ever been moved by music? Have you every enjoyed these simple things in life? That night, I finally realized Why you left the dinner in such sadness I want to make you happy I'll use every means I have to make you happy Delicious (Magical Soul Ritual) Why? That day, I decided to show you my Magical Soul Ritual Watching you so sad I was sad too Watching you cry I cried with you I keep asking about what's going on between Xiami and JK But I fear the answer will hurt my relationship with her So better to avoid the issue and hide Besides, I'm used to hiding from problems Weird girl... Sleepwalking again Spending the night with her was amazing... The sun is scorching I should find her some shade Oh, and get her a towel I really didn't mean to investigate her Why did she choose to leave instead of explaining? Do I mean so little to her? If I tell her that secret Would it make a difference? Perhaps I should really tell her that secret Lele! Lele! Hello, is Lele around please? Are you Xiami? Yes Lele has left He said to give this letter to you if you came back I'm Lele's mother You can call me Katherine Thank you Xiami I didn't know my words Would hurt you so badly I can only imagine what you've been through That made you so sensitive And guarded I'm really sorry When my father died Mother considered leaving me with my late father's family And remarrying That's why when I was younger I vowed never to return to the restaurant business Not only because I was afraid of failure But also afraid of losing... my mother's affection Thank you for scolding me earlier Today I'll let go of everything I have And bravely fight for my true dreams Hopefully my bravery Will encourage you to be brave as well To wear your hearing aid again And hear all the sounds around you I don't know when I'll get to see you again But I hope when that time comes You can hear me saying this to you LOVE YOU YOU I left you a small present in the wedding hall I hope you'll like it (Dried Shrimp) Good morning, Xiami!

When they take in for questioning, We collect the workers, saying that they were conspirators. The workers will be guilty. We will be freed of them forever. This is a great idea. While those gangsters will not change their opinion? Dad - they are men of honor. How do we pay them? At $ 500 each. Their four But we must hurry. Ok. Then we agreed. But this man ... And this generation. Where has it gone? Dad, you asked her to go into the garden. Oh yes, I forgot. Wait, I'll take the money. No problem. So who does the work? Remove mays Ben. Here's our chance to get them back. I just tell Ben about the theft, but not about the rest. He, too, will be delayed. He was lucky for so long. We get rid of him. How are you going to go with this? If he tells the cops, we will adjust this matter under him, and then our goose is ready. Why are you so afraid? We ask them to rob the place, and then call the police. Do you think it will be bought at the police? Nobody would believe Ben. He has a criminal record. No court declares him guilty. Really. Mays Ben a job of work for you. - Really? - Of course. Let's talk. Come out for tea. - Over tea? - Yes. Come on, Lee. Sure. We'll talk. Hey, shut the door. Mei, what do you think he will do with us? I do not know. Can he give up. And can be even more dramatic with us. But we must not give up. It's true. Come on. Ben, monitors Chetyrehglazym Joe. You can not trust him. Calmly. I know we can not trust him. A Cheng, you are going. Sure. Divide. Hey, Joe. Already time? No, you still have 15 minutes. When they would get here, I'll keep them zhivehonkimi. Call the police. Gotcha. Ok. Who is it? It's me, May. A Cheng. Yes, everything is asleep? Yes, what are you doing? - We have come to rob the place. -- What? I came with my teacher. A Cheng, do not. If I'm not going, what else do I do? No, A Cheng. Listen to me. Why so long? Give me a look. You navlechesh trouble for everyone. Right. Do not do it. Well, I'll tell the teacher. Be careful. Someone's coming. You petty brat. What to you think you're doing? I have come to kill you. I'll kill you, four-Joe. A Cheng, what are you doing? Oh, you're here. We are all here. Teacher is Chetyrehglazy Joe. It is usually all the time I was threatened. Hello, police? Do not move. Why do you call the police? Do not kill me. It's not my fault. This was the idea, Joe. Please. Please. What's happening? Robbers. Please do not. You again. It was cops? Teacher, is the son of the manager. Son of a bitch. Why do you call the police? It was all Joe's idea. Our workers are on strike and are not going to leave. Joe wanted to bribe you to steal from the factory and blame the workers, to get rid of them But Joe wanted to get rid of you too. Once you've arrived, I called the cops and all arrested. This bastard is no honor. Cheng, keep an eye on him. Do not move. What are you doing? Bastard. Come. shut them in. Now take all that there is No, it would be dishonorable You killed a man. Do you want us to substitute Mr Lee, you remember me? You locked me in a couple of days. I know you are a man of honor. You need to take into account what you should do and what should not. we are all poor and oppressed We all have parents and families. we are all here working in order to simply survive and now we substituted If you really want justice You must help us You will? Master, I am with my sisters. Mr Lee, we will not forget. Well, go. I take full responsibility Teacher, I will always follow you I'm staying with you as a hero. No, A Cheng. We are not heroes. Think about it. We need to steal to survive. This is heroism? Go, Ben. You also go. How can we go without you? There are no more crimes. Find a decent job. You just have to work hard. You want your child to go with me? No. It should no longer be with us. \"Take him home. Give him some of my money. So, they can do farming in the villages. No, Master, I'll stay with you. What? Posleduesh for me and die. Sir, on behalf of workers I just want to say that we want adequate compensation for our work. If you're willing to pay us for it There will be no problems Thank you, Counselor Cam. Not at all Counselor Cam, I'm so sorry. But my recent terrible state I have a headache, abdominal pain, backache I want to go home and rest. Yes, of course. Sorry. Counselor, what about Charles? All hard Whats up. Damn boy - Dad, you're late. - What is it? Stepmother Sei lost Where did? She left with the Secretary of Lau. They did not say where. He left a note. Note? Yes, sir. Ai-ya-ya-rd, she ran away with him. Son of a bitch! Mr Hung, we have come to discuss school construction. Sir. Sir. You do not need to look like we're leaving.

{"title": "X-Men: The Last Stand (2006) - full transcript", "plot": "When a cure is created, which apparently can turn any mutant into a normal human being, there is outrage amongst the mutant community. Whilst some mutants do like the idea of a cure, including Rogue, many mutants find that there shouldn't be a cure. Magneto, who still believes a war is coming, recruits a large team of mutants to take down Warren Worthington II and his cure. Might seem easy for the X-Men to stop, but Magneto has a big advantage, which Wolverine doesn't have. Jean Grey has returned, and joined with Magneto. The Phoenix has woken within her, which has the ability to destroy anything in her way, even if that 'anything' is a X-Men.", "transcript": "foodval.com - stop by if you're interested in the nutritional composition of food   ---  \n        I still don't know why l'm here. Couldn't you just make them say yes? Yes, I could, but it's not my way. And I would expect you, of all people, would understand my feelings about the misuse of power. Ah, \"power corrupts\" and all that. Yes, I know, Charles. When are you going to stop lecturing me? When you start listening. And you're here because I need you. We're not gonna have to meet every one ofthem in person, are we? No. This one's special. What a beautiful campus. \n \n \n \n    (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n \n John, don't you think? Yes, the brochure is great. But what aboutJean? What about her... illness? - Illness? -John. You thinkyour daughter is sick, Mr. Grey? Perhaps it would be best if we were to speak to her, alone. Ofcourse. Jean? Can you come down, dear? We'll, uh, leave you then. It's very rude, you know, to read my thoughts or Mr. Lehnsherr's... without our permission. Did you think you were the only one ofyour kind, young lady? We're mutants,Jean. We are like you. Really? I doubt that. Oh, Charles. \n \n \n \n    (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n \n I like this one. You have more power than you can imagine,Jean. The question is, will you control that power... or let it control you? Warren? Son, is everything all right? - What's going on in there? - Nothing! I'll be right out. Come on. You've been in there for over an hour. Open the door. Warren? One second! Open this door! Warren? Let me in there right now! Open the door! Oh, God. Not you. Dad, I'm sorry. The whole world's goin' to hell, you'rejust gonna sit there? Let's go. Bobby! Thanks, Kitty. - We're getting killed out here. - Yeah, I know. They're not ready, Storm. - Logan. - Oh, don't get your panties in a bunch. That was my last cigar. Logan! lt's getting closer! - Come on! Let's keep moving! - Hey, Tin Man! Come here! - How's your throwing arm? - Logan, we work as a team. Yeah, good luck with that. Throw me. Now! Damn it, Logan! Don't do this! Class dismissed. Hey, Colossus, nice throw. Simulation complete. What the hell was that? Danger Room session. You know what I mean. Oh, lighten up, Storm. Look, you can'tjust change the rules when you feel like it. I'm tryin' to teach 'em something. I taught 'em something. It was a defensive exercise. Yeah. Best defense is a good offense. Or is it the other way around? This isn't a game, Logan. Well, you sure fooled me. Hey, I'm just a sub. You got a problem, talk to Scott. - Scott! -Jean. Scott. Scott. Scott. Scott. Are you okay? I'm fine. Well, you don't seem fine. You seem like you're avoiding me. I mean, something's wrong. What's wrong is I can't touch my boyfriend without killin' him. Other than that, I'm wonderful. Hey. I don't think that's fair. Have I ever put any pressure on you? You're a guy, Bobby. Your mind's only on one thing. Hey, Scott, they were lookin' foryou downstairs. You didn't show. What do you care? Well, for starters, I had to coveryour ass. I didn't askyou to. No, you didn't. The professor did. I wasjust passing through. So pass through, Logan. Hey, look. I know howyou feel. Don't. When Jean died― I said don't. Maybe it's time for us to move on. Not everybody heals as fast as you, Logan. Mr. Secretary? Yes. - The meeting's begun, sir. - Thankyou. Mr. President. Have a seat, Hank. Homeland Security was tracking Magneto. We got hits in Lisbon, Geneva, Montreal. NAVSAT lost him crossing the border. But we did get a consolation prize. We picked her up breaking into the F.D.A., ofall places. Do you know who she's been imitating? Secretary Trask here. Yes, sir. She can do that. Not anymore, she can't. We got her. You thinkyour prisons can hold her? We have some new prisons, Hank. We'll keep them mobile. Be a step ahead this time. Where is Magneto? Raven? Raven, I asked you a question. I don't answer to my slave name. Raven Darkholme. That's your real name, isn't it? Or has he convinced you you don't have a family anymore? My family tried to kill me, you pathetic meat sack. Okay, then. Mystique. Where is he? In here with us. I don't want to play games with you. I want answers. You don't want to play games with me? You are gonna stop this. Tell me, where is Magneto? You want to know where he is? Homo sapien! You know her capture will only provoke Magneto. But having her does give us some diplomatic leverage. On principle, I can't negotiate with these people. I thought that's why you appointed me, sir. Yes, it is. But that's not why you called me here. No. This is. It's what she stole from the F.D.A. Dear Lord. Is it viable? We believe it is. You realize the level of impact this will have on the mutant community? Yes, I do. That's precisely why we need some ofyour... diplomacy now. When an individual acquires great power, the use or misuse of that power is everything. Will it be for the greater good? Or will it be used for personal or for destructive ends? Now, this is a question we must all ask ourselves. Why? Because we are mutants. For psychics, this presents a particular problem. When is it acceptable to use our power, and when do we cross that invisible line... that turns us into tyrants over our fellow man? But Einstein said that ethics are an exclusive human concern... without any superhuman authority behind it. Einstein wasn't a mutant... so far as we know. Now, this case study was sent to me by a colleague, Dr. Moira MacTaggert.Jones? The man you see here was born with no higher-level brain functions. His organs and nervous system work, but he has no consciousness to speak of. Now, what ifwe were to transfer the consciousness ofone person, say a father offour with terminal cancer, into the body ofthis man? How are we to decide what falls within the range of ethical behavior and what― Professor? We'll continue this tomorrow. Class dismissed. The forecast was for sunny skies. Oh. I'm sorry. I don't have to be psychic to see that something's bothering you. l don't understand. Magneto's a fugitive. We have a mutant in the cabinet, a president who understands us. Why are we still hiding? We're not hiding. But we still have enemies out there. And I must protect my students. You know that. Yes, but we can't be students forever. Storm, I hadn't thought ofyou as my student foryears. In fact, I thought that, perhaps, you might take my place some day. But Scott's— Scott's a changed man. He tookJean's death so hard. Yes, things are better out there. But you, ofall people, know how fast the weather can change. There's something you're not tellin' us. Hank? Ororo! Charles. Oh! I love what you've done with your hair. Mmm. You too. Thanks. Thankyou for seeing me on such short notice. Henry, you are always welcome here. You're a part ofthis place. - I have news. - Is it Eric? No. Though we have been making some progress on that front. - Mystique was recently apprehended. - Who's the furball? Hank McCoy, Secretary of Mutant Affairs. Right, right. The secretary. Nice suit. - Henry, this is Logan. He's, uh― - Wolverine. - I hearyou're quite an animal. - Look who's talkin'. You know Magneto's gonna come get Mystique, right? Magneto's not the problem. At least not our most pressing one. A major pharmaceutical company has developed a mutant antibody— - a way to suppress the mutant \"X\" gene. - Suppress? Permanently. They're calling it a cure. Well, that's ridiculous. You can't cure being a mutant. Well, scientifically speaking― Since when did we become a disease? How can anybody in their right― Storm. They're announcing it now. These so-called mutants are peoplejust like us. Their affliction is nothing more than a disease, a corruption of healthy cellular activity. But I stand here today to tell you there's hope. And this site, once the world's most famous prison, will now be the source offreedom for all mutants who choose it. Ladies and gentlemen, I proudly present... the answer to mutation. Finally, we have a cure. Who would want this cure? I mean, what kind ofcoward would take itjust to fit in? Is it cowardice to save oneselffrom persecution? Not all of us can fit in so easily. You don't shed on the furniture. Well, for all we know, the government helped cook this up. - I can assure you the government had nothing to do with this. - Well, I've heard that before. My boy, I have been fighting for mutant rights since before you had claws. Did hejust call me \"boy\"? Is it true? They can cure us? Yes, Rogue. It appears to be true. No, Professor. They can't cure us. You want to know why? Because there's nothin' to cure. Nothing's wrong with you. Or any of us, for that matter. How should we, as mutants, respond? Here's what I think. This is about getting organized, bringing our complaints to the right people. We need to put together a committee and talk to the government. They don't understand. They don't know what it means to be a mutant. We need to show them, educate them, let them know that we're here to stay. Come on. People, you must listen. - They won't take us seriously. - They want to exterminate us. This cure is voluntary. Nobody's talking about extermination. No one ever talks about it. Theyjust do it. And you go on with your lives, ignoring the signs all around you. And then, one day, when the air is still and the night has fallen, - they come foryou. - Excuse me, but-- It's only then you realize, while you were talking about organizing and committees, the extermination has already begun. Make no mistake, my brothers. They will draw first blood. They will force their cure upon us. The only question is, will you join my brotherhood and fight... or wait for the inevitable genocide? Who will you stand with― the humans... or us? You talk pretty tough for a guy in a cape. Back off. Ifyou're so proud of being a mutant, where's your mark? I have been marked once, my dear, and let me assure you... no needle shall ever touch my skin again. You know who you're talkin' to? Do you? And what can you do? Hmm. So, you have talents. That and more. I know you control metal. And I know there's 87 mutants in here and none ofthem above a class three, other than you two. You can sense other mutants and their powers? Mm-hmm. Could you locate one for me? Let me out of here! l demand that you release me! Do you know who l am? I'm the president ofthe United States. Oh, Mr. President. Shut up! Why are you doing this to me? Let me down. l'll be a good girl. Please, let me go. Please? Keep it up. I'll sprayyou in the face, bitch. When I get out of here, I'm gonna kill you myself. Yeah, right. Secretary McCoy, welcome to Worthington Labs. Thankyou, Dr. Rao. Not an easy place to get to. It's the safest location we could find. That's why we keep the source ofthe cure here. He is a mutant. You understand our concern. We are in full compliance with your department's policy. How long will you keep the boy here? Until we can fully map his D.N.A. We can replicate it, but we can't generate it. And his power, what is its range? You'll see. Jimmy? There's someone I would like you to meet. Hello there, son. - Hi. - My name is Hank McCoy. I'm sorry. It's okay. You have an amazing gift. Thankyou,Jimmy. Extraordinary, isn't he? Yes, he is. Scott. Scott. Scott. Scott. Can you hear me? I'm still here. Scott. Scott. Stop. I'm here, Scott! Stop it. Scott. Scott. Scott! Stop it. - Scott! Scott! - Stop! Jean? Scott? How? I don't know. I want to see your eyes. Take these off. No. No. Trust me. I can control it now. Open them. You can't hurt me. Scott. Scott. Scott. Scott. What happened? No clue! Professor, you okay? Get to Alkali Lake. You don't want to be here. Do you? I can't see a damn thing. I can take care ofthat. What the― Logan! Oh, God. She's alive. Jean? The sheer mass ofwater that collapsed on top ofJean should have obliterated her completely. The only explanation ofJean's survival is that her powers... wrapped her in a cocoon oftelekinetic energy. Is she gonna be okay? Jean Grey is the only class five mutant I've ever encountered, her potential practically limitless. Her mutation is seated in the unconscious part ofher mind, and therein lay the danger. When she was a girl, I created a series of psychic barriers... to isolate her powers from her conscious mind. And, as a result, Jean developed a dual personality. What? The consciousJean, whose powers were always in her control... and the dormant side, a personality that, in our sessions, came to call itself the Phoenix― a purely instinctual creature, all desire and joy... and rage. She knew all this? It's unclear how much she knew. Far more critical is whether the woman in front of us is theJean Grey we know... or the Phoenix furiously struggling to be free. She looks pretty peaceful to me. Because I'm keeping her that way. I'm trying to restore the psychic blocks and cage the beast again. What have you done to her? Logan, you have to understand― - You're talkin' about a person's mind here, aboutJean. - She has to be controlled. Control? You know, sometimes when you cage the beast, the beast gets angry. You have no idea. You have no idea ofwhat she's capable. No, Professor. l had no idea what you were capable of. I had a terrible choice to make. I chose the lesser oftwo evils. Well, it sounds to me likeJean had no choice at all. I don't have to explain myself, least ofall to you. History will be made here today. For the first time, the so-called \"mutant cure\" will be available to the public. Now, reaction has run the gamut, with mutants on both sides ofthe line. Some are desperate for this cure, while others are offended by the very idea of it. Is Secretary McCoy going to be a problem? Hard to say. His political views seem somewhat at odds with his personal issues. Excuse me, sir? Your son's arrived. Good. Bring him in. You sure you want to start with him? I think it's important, yes. - Hello, Warren. - How are you, Son? You sleep well? Yeah. You know, I'm proud ofyou for doing this. Everything's gonna be fine. I promise. Yeah. You ready? The transformation can be a littlejarring. Dad, can we talk about this for a sec? We've talked about it, Son. It'll all be over soon. Everything's going to be fine. Wait. - I can't do this. - Warren, calm down. - No. I-I can't do this. - Yes, you can. - Okay,just give me a minute― -Just relax, Son. Take it easy. - No! I can't do this! - Calm down. I promise you, it will be fine! Dad! Warren, relax! Warren, it's a better life. It's what we all want. No. It's what you want. Warren! No! Told you so. - About time. - I've been busy. Did you find what you were looking for? The source ofthe cure is a mutant, a child at Worthington Labs. Without him, they have nothing. Read offthe guest list. Cell 41 205. James Madrox. This one robbed seven banks... - at the same time. - I could use a man ofyour talents. I'm in. Welcome to the Brotherhood. Careful with this one. Cain Marko. Solitary confinement. Now, check this out. \"Prisoner must be confined at all times. - lfhe builds any momentum, no object can stop him.\" - How fascinating. - And what do they call you? -Juggernaut. - I can't imagine why. - You gonna let me out of here? I need to pee. - Nice helmet. - Keeps my face pretty. - I think he'll make a fine addition to our army. - Yeah. No! You saved me. Eric? I'm sorry, my dear. You're not one of us anymore. Such a shame. She was so beautiful. You think resigning's gonna make a difference? That's no way to influence policy. Policy is being made without me, Mr. President. The decision to turn the cure into a weapon was made without me. What happened on that convoy was inexcusable. But your actions― Hank, that was an isolated incident. You have to understand. Those mutants were a real threat. Have you even begun to think what a slippery slope you're on? I have. And I worry about how democracy survives when one man can move cities with his mind. As do I. You and I know that it's only going to get worse. All the more reason why I need to be where I belong. Jean. - Hey, Logan. - Welcome back. Back where we first met. Only I was in your place and you were in mine. You okay? Yeah. More than okay. Logan, you're making me blush. - Are you reading my thoughts? - I don't have to. It's okay. - Wait. - No. Jean, this isn't you. Yes. Yes, it is me. No. Maybe you ought to take it easy, huh? The professor said you might be... different. He would know, wouldn't he? What? You think he's not in your head too? Look at you, Logan. He's tamed you. Where's Scott? Jean? Where am I? You're in the mansion. You need to tell me what happened to Scott. Jean, tell me what happened to him. Oh, God. Look at me. Jean, stay with me. Talk to me. Look at me. Look at me! No. Focus! Focus,Jean! Kill me. What? Kill me before I kill someone else. Don't say that. Please. Stop it. Kill me. Stop it. Look at me. Look at me.Jean. It'll be all right. We can help you. Okay? The professor can help. He can fix it. I don't want to fix it! Voluntary? They put the cure in a gun. I told you they would draw first blood. - So what do we do? - What do we do? We use this weapon as a lightning rod to bring countless more to our cause. Come. We have an army to build. I picked something up. An electromagnetic force. It's massive. It's... a mutant. Class five. More powerful than anything I've ever felt. More powerful than you. Where is she? Logan? Jean?Jean! What happened? What have you done? - I think she killed Scott. - What? - That's not possible. - I warned you. She's left the mansion, but she's trying to block my thoughts. She's so strong. It may be too late. Wait for me here. What? I need to seeJean alone. You were right, Charles. This one is special. What the hell are you doing here? The same as the professor. Visiting an old friend. I don't want trouble here. Nor do I, Charles. So, shall we go inside? I came to bringJean home. Don't interfere, Eric. Just like old times, huh? She needs help. Jean is not well. Funny. You sound just like her parents. Nobody gets inside. I knewyou'd come. Ofcourse. I've come to bring you home. I have no home. Yes, you do. You have a home and a family. - He thinks your power is too great foryou to control. - Eric. I don't believe your mind games are going to work anymore, Charles. So you want to control me? No. He does. No. I want to help you. Help me? What's wrong with me? - Absolutely nothing. - Eric, stop! No, Charles! Not this time! You've always held her back! Foryour own good,Jean. Stay out of my head. I'm goin' in. The professor said he'd handle this. Look at me,Jean. I can help you. Look at me! No. Get out of my head. - Perhaps you should listen to her, Charles. - You must trust me. You're a danger to everyone and yourself! But I can help you! - I thinkyou want to give her the cure! - Look what happened to Scott! You killed the man you love because you couldn't control your power! No! Stop it! That's it. Jean, let me in. No,Jean! Jean! Don't let it control you. Charles! My dear, come with me. Oh, God! No. We live in an age ofdarkness, a world full offear, hate and intolerance. But in every age, there are those who fight against it. Charles Xavierwas born into a world divided, a world he tried to heal― a mission he never saw accomplished. It seems the destiny of great men to see their goals unfulfilled. Charles was more than a leader, more than a teacher. He was a friend. When we were afraid, he gave us strength. And when we were alone, he gave us a family. He may be gone, but his teachings... live on through us, his students. Whereverwe may go, we must carry on his vision. And that's a vision ofa world united. Kitty? Bobby? - You okay? - Yeah. Ah, it'sjust... Xavier came to my house. He was the one that convinced me to come here. Yeah, me too. We're all feelin' the same way, you know. No, Bobby, we're not. You have Rogue and I have― You know, I― I just miss home. The first snow and all ofthat. - Kitty, get up. Come with me. - Storm told us to stay in our rooms. Don't worry. We won't get caught. I mean, you can walk through walls, you know. Come on. This place can be home too. Bobby. Bobby! Okay. Come on. Whoa! Thank you for this, Bobby. You need a lift, kid? No. Where're you going? You don't know what it's like to be afraid ofyour powers, to be afraid to get close to anybody. Yeah, I do. I wanna be able to touch people, Logan. A hug, a handshake, a kiss. I hope you're not doing this for some boy. Look, ifyou wanna go, then go. Just be sure it's what you want. Shouldn't you be telling me to stay, to go upstairs and unpack? I'm not your father. I'm your friend. Think about what I said, Rogue. Marie. Do you remember when we first met? Do you know what I saw when I looked at you? I saw the next stage in evolution, what Charles and I dreamt offinding. And I thought to myself, \"Why would Charles... want to turn this goddess into a mortal?\" I can manipulate the metal in this, but you― you can do anything, anything you can think of. Jean― Enough. Enough! You sound just like him. Jean, he wanted to hold you back. What do you want? I want you to be what you are, as nature intended. That cure is meant for all of us. Ifwe want freedom, we must fight for it. And that fight begins now. She shouldn't be here with us. Her power's completely unstable. Only in the wrong hands. You trust her? She's one ofthem. So were you once. I stuck with you all the way. I would've killed the professor ifyou'd given me the chance. Charles Xavier did more for mutants than you'll ever know. My single greatest regret is that he had to die for our dream to live. So what now? What do we do? Professor Xavier started this school, perhaps it's best that it end with him. We'll have to tell the students they're going home. Must of us don't have anywhere to go. I can't believe this. I can't believe we're not gonna fight for this school. l'm sorry. l know this is a bad time. I was told that this was a safe place for mutants. It was, son. And it still is. We'll find you a room. Hank, tell all the students this school stays open. Rogue. Hey, Rogue. Hey, Pete, you seen Rogue? Yeah, she took off. Logan. Logan! Logan. Jean? Logan, where am l? Logan! Logan. Logan. Logan. God! Logan! Logan. Logan. Logan. Where are you goin'? Where do you think? She's gone, Logan. She's not comin' back. - You don't know that. - She killed the professor. It wasn'tJean. TheJean I know is still in there. Listen― Outta my way. Why can't you see the truth, huh? Why can't you just let her go? Because― Because― Because you love her. She made her choice. Now it's time we make ours. So ifyou're with us, then be with us. We don't need a cure! We don't need a cure! Gettin' the cure so you can go back home to Mommy and Daddy? I'm lookin' for someone. Oh, l get it. Your girlfriend. I figured she'd want the cure. She's pathetic. Come on, Iceman. Make a move. Same old Bobby. Still afraid ofa fight! Today's attack was only our first salvo. So long as the cure exists, our warwill rage. Your cities will not be safe. Your streets will not be safe. You will not be safe. And to my fellow mutants, I make you this offer-- join us or stay out ofourway. Enough mutant blood has been spilled already. We're tryin' to track him, sir. We're working hard. We cannot let him do this. You know I agree, sir. This is now a national security matter. Seize and secure Worthington Labs. I want troops armed with cure weapons deployed immediately. Yes, sir. And, Trask, you have to find Magneto and stop him, by any means necessary. Magneto wants a war. We'll give him one. Let's go! Keep it movin'! Turn in your old weapon. Turn in all metal― bayonets, magazines, dog tags. Pick up your plastic weapons. Pick up your cure cartridge. Absolutely no metal. We don't need a cure. We don't need a cure. Members of the Brotherhood― They wish to cure us. But I say to you, we are the cure! The cure for their infirm, imperfect condition called... Homo sapiens. They have theirweapons. We have ours. We will strike with a vengeance and a fury... that this world has never witnessed. And ifany mutants stand in our way, we will use this poison against them. We shall go to Alcatraz Island, take control ofthe cure... and destroy its source. And then, nothing can stop us! Jean? l know the smell ofyour adamantium from a mile away. I didn't come here to fight you. - Smart boy. - I came forJean. You think I'm keeping her against her will? She's here because she wants to be. You don't know what you're dealing with. I know full well. I saw what she did to Charles. And you just stood there and let him die? I'm not leaving here without her. Yes, you are. Whoa― Okay. Two minutes to rendezvous, Mr. President. We have a satellite feed of Magneto's base ofoperations. - How did we find it? - She gave us everything we wanted and more. Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned. Approaching target dead ahead. Set for 360-degree incursion. This is Team Leader to Bravo One. We are green to go. Okay. Send them in. Okay. Freeze, mutants! Get your hands in the air! Okay. I give up. Sorry, Mr. Secretary. lt was a decoy. If he's not there, then where the hell is he? Worthington Labs. It ends where it began. Are you sure the boy's still inside? 1 00%. So how we supposed to get there? 'Cause I don't swim. Leave that to me. Storm? Storm? What are you doing back here? I need help. You found her. Yeah. She's with Magneto. Where are they? They're on the move. I know where they're going. You're saying you saw Magneto? Yeah. Gotta go now. They're going to attack Alcatraz. There are troops stationed on that island. Not enough to stop him. Let's suit up. I don't believe this once fit me. If Magneto gets ahold ofthat cure, there will be no stopping him. Can you estimate how many he has? An army. And Jean. His powers have limits, hers do not. There's only six of us, Logan. Yeah. We're outnumbered. I'm not gonna lie to you. But we lost Scott. We lost the professor. lf we don't fight now, everything they stood for will die with them. I'm not gonna let that happen. Are you? Then we stand together, X-Men, all of us. We're in. Let's go. They're ready. Yeah, I know. But are you ready... to do what you need to do when the time comes? Dad, what's going on? It's an earthquake. We're trapped! Cheese― Charles always wanted to build bridges. My God! Fall back! Take cover! Fall back! The boy's in the southeast corner ofthe building. Well done. Let's take it down! In chess, the pawns go first. Humans and their guns. Plastic. They've learned. That's why the pawns go first. Target the bridge! Bring out the launcher! - This is it! - Ready! Load! Fire! Arclight, use your shock waves! Target those weapons! Oh, my stars and garters. Goin' to stealth mode. What aboutjets, tanks? Against Magneto? He'll turn 'em inside out. - Where are our ground troops? - Thirty minutes away. Then God help us. They're coming for him. Get the humans! Whoa! Don't ever do that again. You men, cover the doors! Everybody, get together! And hold this line! Traitors to their own cause. Finish them! Not yet. Go inside, get the boy and kill him. With pleasure. Hold it! - He's going for the boy! - Not if I get there first! Kitty! Come on! Grow those back. Don't you know who I am? I'm theJuggernaut, bitch! Going somewhere? You're the guy that invented the cure, right? Yes, I am. Girls? No! Don't! Don't hurt him! - No! Don't hurt him! - Let go ofme! l didn't do anything. Calm down. Calm down. Everything's gonna be okay. I thought you were a diplomat. As Churchill said, \"There comes a time when all men must―\" Oh, you get the point! Oh, no! No. Please! No, no, don't! No! No, don't worry. I'm here to help you. I'm gonna get you out of here. This way. Oh, my God. What's going on? Your powers won't work with me. Stay close, all right? Okay. I'm the wrong guy to play hide-and-seek with. Who's hiding, dickhead? Don't! No! Don't! D― Please, don't do this! I only wanted to help you people. Do we look like we need your help? It's time to end this war. Take cover! Get out ofthe way! Come on! Let's go! Go! Go! Go! We work as a team. Best defense is a good offense. Run! Bobby! You thinkyou can take out your old friend? Go ahead. Storm, we're gonna need some cover. Right. You're in over your head, Bobby. Maybe you should go back to school. You never should've left. This is it. Hey. Make it a strike. You never learn, do you? Actually, I do. I'm― One ofthem? This is what they want for all of us. It's over,Jean. It's over. No! Don't shoot! No! No-- Everybody, get out of here! Bobby! What have I done? I'm the only one who can stop her. Get everyone to safety. Go! Jean! Jean, I know you're still there! You would die for them? No. Not for them. For you. For you. Save me. I love you. No! You're back. I'm sorry. I had to. This isn't what I wanted. I know. It's what I wanted. Don't worry, Dad. l'll call. Hey. Good to see you, buddy. And so it is with the thanks ofa grateful nation... that I introduce our new ambassador to the United Nations... and the representative to the world... for all United States citizens, human and mutant alike— Dr. Hank McCoy.

Of course If you don't want to strip, you can go to the toilet Officer Li, I don't think you need me Why?

Charge him with misconduct Hi everyone, here is the evening news The pervert who committed rape at Shek Kip Mei Wang Tau Hom, Wong Tai Sin a few months ago appeared again in the vicinity of Saint Betty School, Clearwater Bay Road Now please view the live report from our reporter at the scene Dear viewers, we are now at Saint Betty School at Clearwater Bay Road where the rapist struck again The victim this time is a fifteen year old student from Saint Betty School  Stop shooting... When the incident occurred school was just finishing When the victim parted with another school mate she was dragged into the woods by the offender and raped behind a government pipe room It's this year's seventh rape case I will now interview sergeant Liang who is in charge of investigation in this case sergeant According to police records this is the seventh rape case this year what are the police doing to capture the rapist? We will increase patrolling policemen around schools but since there are many female students and we are short on man power we have to remind schools and parents to be on the alert Their children should go home immediately after school and shouldn't loiter Peak Rd. Oh, it's so hot It's tiring Let's go and have a drink Okay, let's go and have a drink then Bye Bye See you tomorrow Help! Help!... Got you Help! Stop screaming Wang Tai Sin CID Brother Pui, your phone I'll settle this case What's up? Again? Yes He's now changed his location to the peak Sergeant, it's big trouble this time I know, another case at the peak There's something else you don't know The victim is the daughter of the police commissioner Sergeant, this time you'll be directly accountable to the commissioner Don't use the commissioner to pressure me aren't all the others human beings? Don't force me As things stand right now I can do nothing even if it were the Governor's daughter Sergeant, I warn you if you don't solve this case you lot will be transferred to the reservoir Go and check at CRD if this man has prior criminal record? You... No need to say anything, I haven't had garlic today Damn, I hate him so much You shouldn't have such attitude for your superior What's the concern? I am retiring soon Get the information quickly Our boss is really pushing his luck Sir What is it? Evidence from the crime scene Tennis racket and magazines Are they the caucasian girl's? Yes Any finger prints? Yes But he has no criminal record so we have no information on his background Was the magazine torn like this when you picked it up? Yes Maybe he was just playing Get a copy of the same magazine at once Yes Tear off only those with big breasts, not the small Do you remember the ages of the victims? There were 2 fourteen year old girls and 2 fifteen year old The recent ones were below sixteen Strange coincidence indeed All the victim's ages were below sixteen He only likes girls with small breasts Right, brother Pui? I think so too Apart from Central area where could one get it? There are many such shops in the T.S.T. tourist area Send some men to stake out Yes Sir, so many people buy pornography who should we look out for? Look for someone whose hands are white with skin disease Get a few more men to central to canvass book stores selling foreign magazines Monitor men buying pornography Fatty chan Take a few men to Tsim Sha Tsui Give me copy of Sing Tao newspaper He'll not appear, you'd better go Here are two dollars, I'll select another book Wait, let me see You tore up the ones last time How could I sell them? Alright, take your pick Going? You go first These books are no goods for youngsters If you have the urge 20 odd bucks at Temple Street will surely satisfy it Sir, look at that man's hands I'll take it then Don't tear them up again Boss, that man's hands seem to have a skin disease aren't you concerned he might contaminate your books? He doesn't have skin disease he is a shampoo boy whose hands have been corroded So he is a shampoo boy I think it is him No wonder all victims say his hands are horrible His hands have been corroded by shampoo Let's catch him and beat a confession out of him Be patient, white hands and a reader of pornography do not necessarily make him a rapist We must get evidence from the crime scene If they don't have that he'll get of easily Did you know that, of the 80 cases last year and the 32 in which the rapists were caught how many convictions were there? Almost half Right This is because our law against rape has loopholes causing psychological and emotional trauma and shame to the victims Then they have to endure unbearable questions from the defendant's lawyer So in this case I must get enough evidence first How do you intend to draw him out? Dad, why are you staring at me? I have a favour to ask What is it?  Are you winning or losing? I've won 18 rounds So awesome I've lost over 10 rounds Please make me more beautiful I like his movies So do I Your trade is quite challenging Make me beautiful Don't worry I'll be going to a party with my boyfriend You are experienced Ah Choi Go to the movies with me after work, okay?

What do you mean by that? Even if I talk to you about this, I don't know if you'll believe it... Please just tell me. I'm Akira Mononobe. I'm studying ethnology at Jounan University. Ethnology? Yeah. In ancient Japan, there was a custom to sacrifice young women to the gods in order to ward off catastrophes. In Ashikari Village too, where you are... From the beginning, Ashikari was a village of woodcutters. While the men were away chopping trees from mountain to mountain, in order to make sure the women didn't run off, the men chopped off the women's left legs. That was the start of the horrible custom. As time went on, the villagers captured traveling women and worshipped them as living gods to offer to the mountain. The women that were turned into living gods had their left legs cut off and were imprisoned in a small mountain shrine. As for that custom, it's being quietly practiced to this day. All the villagers were dragging their legs, right? When children are born, they cut the tendons in their left legs. As proof of association, but also to keep them from escaping the village. Impossible! I can understand how you don't want to believe it. But you must've seen it too. The scarecrows posted all over the village... Those aren't decorations. They mummified the women who died and worship them as guardians of the village. Be careful. The ritual has already started. We've brought you some lights. Dark places are dangerous. Please open the door, miss. What's wrong? Hey, what's going on? Hello? Hello? Hello... Please tell me your name. It's Shiyori Mizuno... Shiyori... I want to help you. You can believe my story or get your leg chopped off by them. You only have one of those two choices! Hello? Hello? Mr. Mononobe! Please hold on! Is there something wrong? If you're not going to open it, I'll use my key and come in! Why aren't you answering, Aiko? It's an emergency. Contact me as soon as possible. - Shiyori Out of range Please, Aiko, answer... Please... Receiving... Crisis! I'm waiting at the restroom at the hot spring. - Aiko Akira Mononobe Mr. Mononobe? What's the situation? I managed to get out of the inn area. Did you bring the map of the village? Did you bring the map of the village? Yes... The main entrances and exits are most likely already covered. It's a little far, but there's an old tunnel towards the east end. Please wait for me there. I'm heading there with my car right now. I understand. By the way, I want to ask you something important. How did you find out about Ashikari Village? From a friend in the same club... Her name is Aiko... She invited me to go to a hot spring with her... I have to go save Aiko... How did she find out about Ashikari Village? She said she looked it up online... It's dangerous... As far as I researched, there is no information about Ashikari Village on the Web. That can't be... Then Aiko is... She might be working with them too. Hello? Listen, Shiyori. It's important for you to stay alive and get out of that village. If you want to stay alive, regardless of what happens, don't believe anyone. Hello? Hello? To Hot Spring (Restroom) To Old Tunnel Aiko... Please... Please answer, Aiko. Please... Hello? Hello, Aiko?

Also, it's kind of hard to say this, but you should watch out for Aiko too. What do you mean? I'm not too fond of her... To tell you honestly, I don't really trust her. Shiyori, you;re too nice. I'm sure there are times when you're betrayed, but just believe in yourself and do your best. I actually want to go save you, but with my body the way it is now... I'm sorry. Don't be. To Aiko.

Apparently, there was a girl from work who had feelings for me, and she asked Aiko to break up our relationship. It totally fooled me. Then the one you were kissing back then was... Wait, Shiyori! It was Aiko. Are you serious... I wanted to get back with you somehow, so I left it to Aiko, and she set it up here. Then the one who chose this village really was... Yeah, it was Aiko. I wanted to apologize to you face to face. I'm sorry. I really like y... Hey... Hello? I'm in Asamiya's car right now. Really. I'm glad. I heard everything. About your true colors too. I was right... I was only \"sort of\" to you. I believed for so long... I believed that you were my friend for this long. Shiyori... Shiyori... The truth is you were laughing all the while, right? All the while in your mind, I was a stupid girl for being so down, right? No! Stop making fun of me already! You also knew all about the village's secret, right? What are you talking about?

I wasn't able to reach you for a while. Are you okay? Mr. Mononobe, who are you anyway? My friend looked into it for me. Apparently, your name isn't in the student registry for Jounan University. So that's it, huh? But you definitely said you were from Jounan... I'm an instructor. Did you check the instructor registry too? No way... Welcome to Ashikari Village Hey, Asamiya, that was... Shiyori, please listen. This is new information. I found out the name of the guy who brought my sister to that village. The guy's name is Keiichi Asamiya. He's a former inhabitant of Ashikari.

Oh, yeah, XTC, I remember XTC. \n \n \n \n    (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n \n Don't you dare have him in this documentary!

One of them dies, or two of them dies, or they all die and they all can't stand the sight of each other anymore, Stop! \"Making Plans For Nigel\" The only thing that's worthy of making a documentary about XTC is it's not about the rock and roll bollocks that constitute 99% of other bands. We weren't into any of that rock and roll stuff. \n \n \n \n    (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n \n We're not rock and roll people. We made gently, exploratory pop music, and I actually think we started pretty damn good and then got a lot better. And there's not too many bands can say that's their arc. ♪ We're only making plans for Nigel ♪ The journey that they went on is extraordinary in terms of, you know, musical evolution. You have to look at a band like The Beatles to find anyone that's even comparable in the sense of reinventing themselves over and over again. \"Senses Working Overtime\" ♪ And all the world is football-shaped ♪ I thought these guys ascended to... You know, from great punk roots to a whole other level. The leap forward they'd made to just gorgeous songwriting and gorgeous record-making. ♪ Senses working overtime ♪ He's probably one of the most unique songwriters this country's ever produced. He's got this thing of just taking these melodies that soar, you know. It was kind of mind-blowing. \"Wrapped In Grey\" ♪ Awaken, you dreamers ♪ ♪ Adrift in your bed ♪ Each song is different to the next, let alone each album. It's hard to make one album different to the next, and they do it from song to song. And I think that's one of the reasons why they should be relevant, because they have never done anything that's expected, and that's really rare. \"Easter Theatre\" ♪ Enter Easter and she's dressed in yellow yolk ♪ One of the things I love about them is that you can sort of... You can just sort of sit back and enjoy the musicianship and the beautiful sounds and these melodies. It's songwriting at its highest level. ♪ Enter Easter and she's dressed in yellow yolk ♪ ♪ Now the son has died, the father can be born ♪ ♪ If we'd all breathe in and blow away the smoke... ♪ \"This Is Pop\" ♪ Yeah, yeah, this is pop ♪ ♪ Yeah, yeah, this is ♪ ♪ Pop! ♪ Well, I never thought I was any good at anything until I got more and more into drawing and painting. Comics were a big influence. I loved them, and I thought, \"Do you know, I can draw. Maybe when I grow up I can be a cartoon artist.\" I was a kid that always made my own entertainment. For me, it went with the territory of being an only child. It went with a very, very controlling, OCD mother who wouldn't allow other kids to come into the house to play. I could go round other kids' houses, but for some reason they couldn't come in mine. This was her, \"Oh, I don't want any filth on the floor.\" You could go in everyone else's house and you'd know there were kids living there, there'd be toys around. You'd go in our house - \"No, there's no child lives here,\" you know. And she would constantly throw my toys away. It was like the OCD control thing, you know. It was a constant hurt to have your... You know, you had no brothers and sisters, you weren't close to your parents. The only things you kind of felt any connection with was your toys, and they were always got rid of. So I fought this de-childification of the house. Maybe it's why I love toys so much now. I'm trying to say, \"You ain't gonna throw them out now,\" you know. I was a real Jonny No Mates. I had to make up games, I would design stuff, I would always be drawing. I was always a self-entertainer. And then I was the right age that psychedelia kicked in, '66, '67. Pop music starts getting very colorful, and right about that time music starts to loom really heavily in my life. And suddenly I was just opening up the age of, you know, your balls start dropping, the opposite sex stop being embarrassing and start becoming intensely interesting. It was all hand-in-hand with... I was just the right age. Girls are getting bigger, music's getting bigger, kapow. And it's that thing of, If I'm gonna get off this council estate, I don't think I'm gonna do it by being a graphic artist. I don't wanna have to join the Navy to see the world like my dad. What way is it that I can get out of here? It's gotta be music! It can't be hard writing songs. The girls love them all. This is great. How do you learn to do it? I'm gonna teach myself. I was struggling. I was copying as many records as I could, pulling that stylus back: \"How does that bit go? Oh, no, what's that chord? I don't know what that chord is, I can't find it.\" But I very, very quickly, for all the wrong reasons, quickly got into writing my own songs. And it's for the wrong reasons because I wasn't good enough to learn other people's songs. So, \"Okay, You need to write your own.\" And that's how it grew. It grew, because I couldn't work out other people's stuff. Andy and I grew up on the Penhill council estate. He was the next school year up from me, but we went to the same school. He was the guy that used to draw caricatures of the teachers in the playground, so he always had a crowd around him. He was a good draftsman even then. And then I didn't see him for a couple of years. I think I met him in a music shop, Kempster's. And he was the guy that used to take the expensive guitars off the wall, much to the proprietor's dismay. You know, we'd go in and kind of turn on an amplifier and get a cable that somebody had left from trying a guitar, and when nobody was looking, take a guitar off the wall and plug it in, you know. Then the pair of us would be showing each other licks and riffs and things. Hey, you're Andy Partridge. You write good songs and play the guitar well. That's right. Who are you, mystery bass man? I'm Colin Moulding, and this is Terry Chambers. You must be Terry, the drum player. Yes, I am. I play the drums. Hey, let's go to the pub and talk about being in a group, then. Let's get pissed first. By the time we met, when we were about 17, we still hadn't mastered our instruments. So, we basically sort of learnt along together, but I think Andy was a little bit more advanced musically than what we were. \"Adrenalin\" Well, he was a bolshy bugger even then, you know. Very confident, obviously very talented, so we were happy to go along with his ideas, really. The stuff I wrote for The Helium Kidz I thought had its own sound, because I was taking my love of American comics and science fiction, and I thought, \"I'll write songs about those kind of subjects.\" The songs they were playing were all about two, two and a half minutes long and no-one locally was doing that. We were all kind of underground blues bands. That's really what was going on in the mid-70s, But this was some kind of... It was almost like cartoon pop music, but there was something about it that I hadn't seen in any other local band. I didn't seriously imagine they were gonna get anywhere, because who's gonna take a band from Swindon seriously? It just wasn't gonna happen. Swindon has this reputation for being a comedy place, a backward place, that anything that comes from it is considered to be a joke. It's designated \"the comedy town\" and everything associated with Swindon must be stupid and comical and worthless. Which is terrible when you're trying to... instigate a band from Swindon. \"They must be terrible and comical and worthless.\" \"Neon Shuffle\" Locally, he was viewed as being a bit out there for local tastes, you know. But we thought he was great, because he was a larger-than-life character and he was very funny. And he was making music that was unusual, so we were kinda drawn to that. So the three of us, that was the nucleus of the band, me, Andy and Terry. And the fourth member always seemed to be changing. By the time The Helium Kidz became XTC, we found a keyboard player by the name of Barry Andrews and we went out drinking one night and got awfully sick. So it was like, \"Okay, he's one of the gang. He can hold his beer better than I can, you know, so he's in.\" I had no idea what he played like. And the first rehearsal we had with him I thought, \"Oh, my God, we've said he's in the band and I can't stand his playing. It's like Deep Purple or something,\" you know. And I took him to one side halfway through this rehearsal and I said, \"Do you really wanna play like that? Feel free to play any way you really want to play.\" And the second half of the rehearsal it was, \"My God!\" It was like the sound of somebody repairing a flying saucer engine. It was just so odd and it was so many beautiful wrong notes. \"He is so in this group.\" ♪ When you do it, it ain't no disgrace ♪ We heard that there was a buzz about XTC. \"You gotta see XTC.\" So we went down there, and sure enough they were one of the few bands of that era that dared to break the very strict rules of punk. XTC actually had complex chords, complex rhythms, lyrics that were outside that very narrow frame and it was actually very heartening for us to see a band just throwing of that strait jacket. Hello, my name is John Peel. On tonight's program I'll be playing tracks by The Sloots, The Slots, The Groan, Exploding Truss, The Blues Bastards one from The Geckos, Hubert And His Pile Tones, The Ear, The Nose, The Throat, The Cassowaries from Hell are here, and Inevitable Groin I think Andy sent a tape off to John Peel and got us on the show. That was about four months before we were signed to Virgin and that was our first appearance on the radio. So, on to tonight's first guests, and they're XTC. See what you think. At the time, the music industry was a bit of a closed shop. There wasn't really any way in. But when punk came along, it kind of swept everything aside. And we got in on the punk ticket, I think. But I think we were more akin to the New York Dolls, we weren't really punk as such. We weren't political in any way. ♪ I have a feeling ♪ ♪ Something's looking in-in-in-in-in ♪ Why don't we go to London and be famous, kids? Punk rock is just starting up and they'll swallow anything. ♪ Science friction burns my fingers ♪ The floodgates were opened after the whole so-called punk new wave scene. And, you know, as time went on, the labels kind of dropped away for a band like Blondie or for a band like XTC, you know. You just really... They were just like a great band. I mean, their music was innovative, lyrically interesting and a bit eccentric, I suppose. And I think as time went on, they kinda proved that to be true. By the time XTC got signed up in '77 - and who didn't get signed up in '77, it was like a disease. Record companies were so scared of missing the boat, \"Ah, there's this thing called punk, new wave, whatever it is, we don't know what it's called. Quick, sign everything!\" They just signed everything. So they looked at XTC and, \"Right, you're signed.\" That first record is the one that, to this day, I love it so much. And I love the way it's like post-punky and I really love his guitar playing. It's like that fast, erratic playing, and his singing, it's so cool. ♪ Science friction burns my fingers ♪ So the first XTC album was some of the dregs of the comic stuff, like Neon Shuffle, Science Friction. But there were other things as well that were happening to me at the time, like This Is Pop. Where people are trying to work out what this new music is called. Is it punk And to me, it was just pop music. It was short, sharp, slightly futuristic pop music. I thought, \"Come on, you idiots, don't bother with putting it into yet another sub ghetto. It's just pop music.\" ♪ What do you call that noise ♪ ♪ That you put on? ♪ ♪ This is pop ♪ ♪ Yeah, yeah ♪ ♪ This is pop ♪ ♪ Yeah, yeah ♪ ♪ This is pop ♪ ♪ Yeah, yeah ♪ ♪ This is ♪ His singing voice, of course, on the first record, it was kinda yelping, really. He was always trying to, \"Urgh,\" trying to get above the row of the instruments, you know. It was probably the style of the music and the time, where people thought to sing was to shout. ♪ This is ♪ ♪ Yeah, yeah ♪ ♪ This is pop ♪ I very quickly realized that I can't find another singer who's delivering my songs how I want them delivered. So I'm reluctantly gonna have to sing them, and I'm not a good singer. At best, in the early years, I managed an entertaining seal bark of a noise, \"Arrrhh, arrrhh,\" you know. It was like a wounded Lassie or something. And if Colin writes some songs then he's gonna sing them. I'm not gonna do his songs. So it was that kind of unwritten agreement that you write it, you sing it. ♪ Are you receiving me? ♪ ♪ You are deceiving me, I know ♪ I had no ambition to write. I think it was one of the roadies that said, you know, \"Colin, you ought to write, because otherwise you'll miss out,\" you know. So I made a contribution to the first album. And then on the second album Barry said it would be better all-round if we all made a contribution, and he started to write songs, as well. By the time we got to doing the second record, Go 2, there was Barry's songs that had to be done, you know. Give him a chance kind of thing. And, of course, they stuck out, you know. They weren't really band songs, XTC songs. Barry and I were sniping at each other terribly during the recording of that, 'cause I was seeing that he was kind of in danger of stealing my band away, or was trying to do that from under my nose. From suddenly not writing any songs, he had suddenly written seven songs. But he was very upset that he didn't get them all on the album. But then you can't waltz into a band and say, \"Okay, Mr. Songwriter, we're not having any of your songs. Half of the album is gonna be my songs, which I've just started writing and you have to use them all.\" So I thought, \"No, let's give it a few albums and then we can start to introduce your songs.\" But no, Barry, being the lone wolf, had to leave. ♪ Are you receiving me? ♪ ♪ You are deceiving me ♪ I thought, \"Ah, we can't stop our career now. It's just taking off. Who do I know that we can get in the band? I know, maybe the person we should have had in the first place: local guitarist Dave Gregory.\" A friend of mine and a fantastic guitarist. And, yeah, I think he liked the opportunity to come and be in a band that was on its way up. ♪ I have learned there's a magical spot at the hop ♪ ♪ Ooh-whoo! ♪ I think he just wanted to find someone who he could relate to on a personal level, who'd do what he asked without squabbling too much. But he certainly broadened my mind as to, you know, how I should approach... For example, if he heard even the slightest hint of a blues cliché in anything I was doing, he'd just say, \"Don't do that!\" So he got me thinking in a completely different way. On my audition, we were just jamming on something and I think at one point I went... ..and he went, \"Stop! Stop Ernieing\" And I said \"What?\" \"Stop Ernieing! Don't Ernie. Don't do that.\" ♪ Ernie, Ernie, Ernie ♪ He hated that, so I had to sort of... Straight away, that was the last time I ever played a phrase like that in an XTC song. ♪ Life begins at the hop ♪ ♪ Boys and girls ♪ When Barry left, it seemed to trigger something, you know. The dynamic of the band changed and I was writing more for myself, you know. Colin brought this guitar to the rehearsal room and said, \"I've written this song, fellas, and it goes like this.\" And he played the three or four chords that constitute Making Plans For Nigel. And we liked the melody, thought the melody was really nice. ♪ Da-da-da-da-da-duh, da-duh-da-duh ♪ You know, it's a very old-fashioned melody. It could be Gilbert O'Sullivan, could be, you know, a show tune or something. ♪ We're only making plans for Nigel ♪ ♪ We only want what's best for him ♪ But he's strumming it to us on a classic guitar, and it was, \"Oh, my God. We can't do it like that. He's like Julie Felix or Joan Baez or something. You know, nobody's... We're not gonna take that, let alone our audience. And so we just pulled it totally apart. I got Terry to play in an upside-down drum rhythm, where he moved at quite a conventional rhythm around to other drums. And if you're a drummer, try playing that rhythm on Making Plans For Nigel. It takes some upside-down thinking. I'm just doing these sort of stabbing chords. Over the top of that, Andy's got this little... Colin is copying what is being played on the tom-tom, which is this tribal thing, 'cause we wanna get into that tribal area with drums, you know. So the whole song is this big tribal-sounding behemoth. And, damn it, it was a hit. ♪ We're only making plans for Nigel ♪ ♪ Nigel just needs that helping hand ♪ ♪ And if young Nigel says he's happy ♪ ♪ He must be happy ♪ ♪ He must be happy ♪ ♪ He must be happy in his work ♪ I knew by that album, the album that became Drums And Wires, that I wanted to take the band in a more drum-heavy direction And so we found a producer, an engineer, that I felt would be good for this new sound, which was Hugh Padgham engineering and Steve Lillywhite being the producer. And it was a case of, \"Well, let's get you in a live-sounding studio, where there's plenty of stone and brick and wood and glass to reflect the sound.\" So we went to the brand-new Virgin Town House, which had just been built. The great thing with this room at The Town House was that it was all sort of stone and bricks, so when you stand next to somebody playing the drums, it's loud. And there had become a phenomenon in the '70s, where records tended to have a very sort of dead sound on, well, particularly the drums, and they often didn't sound very big. Now, recording them in this big room, and the technique that I sort of discovered, made the drums sound loud, even when they were quiet. That was the drum... The drum sound of the 1980s. That everybody now knows was made famous by Phil Collins and the big drum break in In The Air Tonight. It was a new sound. It was a new thing. And people were saying to us, you know, like we're touring with The Police and, \"Partsy, man, how are you getting that sound like, with the big drums? Who's doing your engineering, man?\" \"Well, it's a young fella called Hugh Padgham.\" \"Right, have you got his number? We'll have a bit of that on The Police.\" Hugh Padgham came to us because of his unbelievable credentials. He had recorded the albums that everybody held up as the sound that every band wants. The combination of the size and clarity, everybody wanted that sound. ♪ We're only making plans for Nigel ♪ Drums And Wires just changed the game for us. Reinvented the band. Easy to tour. Easy to play on stage. Just put us another notch up the ladder, I guess. It was a double-edged sword for me, because certainly in Britain we'd had no chart success with this odd music. You know, these strange Herberts from a council estate in Swindon. \"It's too odd for me. That's punky, ain't it? That's, well, you know...\" So by the time that Colin came up with Making Plans For Nigel Virgin Records said, \"Hey, that good-looking bass player, he's come up with one and it's in the charts, so, okay, he's the one to look at, and we thought it was Andy's group.\" From then on, for quite a few years, certainly in the eyes of Virgin Records, it became Colin's group. I think he was a little bit pissed off, to be honest, as you can imagine, because, you know, he had been the song writer, you know, the sole song writer. He was the face of the band, so it all felt a little bit odd. Essentially, I was the bass player, but, all of a sudden, I was thrust forward. ♪ Generals and Majors, ah-ha ♪ ♪ They're never too far ♪ ♪ From battlefields so glorious ♪ To be fair, he's the one who looked most like a pop star. You know, all his songs were melodic and simple. They're very easy, easy on the ear, listener-friendly songs. So the record company would always look to Colin for the singles first. So you can understand why Andy might have had his nose put out of joint a little bit because of that. But, you know, he got on with it okay. He still had the lion's share of the writing, and he was still in charge. ♪ Generals ♪ ♪ And Majors ♪ It was kind of good for him as well, because it kind of spurred both of us on, you know. Virgin rule was after the next hit. So in a way, it was healthy after a while. I had that thing where I thought it was my band. You know. And... But I realized it was our band. The fact that Colin was writing good songs, I was writing good songs, Dave was playing great instrumentation orchestration, Terry was whacking seven bells out of that kit beautifully, it all made it stronger. ♪ Towers of London ♪ ♪ When they had built you ♪ ♪ Did you watch over the men who fell? ♪ Andy was getting a reputation by this time as being, you know, a songwriter, as opposed to being, you know, a punk guitar player. Both guys were writing much better songs. I think the two of them complimented each other really. They never actually ever wrote together. They were never a Lennon and McCartney type of partnership. They never wrote songs together. There was his songs, and his songs, and that was it. ♪ Need assisting ♪ Colin had less of the kind of bite and perversity of Andy. Andy has this kind of strange world that he kinda retreats into, that's kind of a mixture of nostalgia and sexual tension, and the fact that it's quintessentially English. ♪ If I could only be tough like him ♪ ♪ Then I could win my own small battle of the sexes ♪ For me, more and more of the influences was the British pop group stuff came out more and more, i.e. The Beatles, Rolling Stones, The Small Faces, The Kinks. The way that Ray Davies wrote these little mini plays about life in England. You know, I loved that. And I sort of gravitated naturally towards wanting to do that myself. You're not stealing, it's just you can't help it. It's in your DNA. You live in a little English town. Just the very fact that you're reporting what's going on in that little English town, it's gonna be a bit like anybody else who wrote about small things in small towns. ♪ Heard the neighbor slam his car door ♪ ♪ Don't you realize, this is Respectable Street? ♪ With Respectable Street, it's this really mundane, supposedly uninteresting story of this suburban, boring life, but they paint this really vivid picture of it. And you can completely see Andy just poking out the curtains, watching it all go on. He's such a character, and that comes out in the lyrics, that comes out in the songs. ♪ Avon lady fills the creases ♪ ♪ When she manages to squeeze in past the caravans ♪ ♪ That never move from their front gardens ♪ So long as the four of us were together, we were in this little Swindon bubble, we were protected, we were among friends. Some of the weird people we met on the road, you know, you just think, \"Well, at least we can laugh about it.\" Because the rock and roll lifestyle is pretty absurd. Particularly on the road. But, you know, Andy, he never stopped. He was always joking and larking around, keeping us happy. It was just his personality. It wasn't something he felt he had to do, he's just a natural, comical person. Humor is an important part of every band's life, and we got on great with XTC. Andy was much more comfortable the further he was away from the show. After the show, Andy is a hoot. We actually shared a tour bus with them, which is two bands on a bus, which is pretty darn neighborly. But we got along really well. You know, XTC and The Police were two similar bands of the same age, and we just, you know, we were in the pocket. ♪ Bang the wall for me to turn, turn, turn ♪ I think we were generally pretty good live. Being tight as a band was important. But I kinda quickly found out that I didn't enjoy the business of live so much. For the travel, the sound checks, all the assholes you have to deal with in agencies and managers. So I hated all that side of it I mean, actually being on stage was the nicest bit of the day. ♪ ..he realize, this is Respectable Street? ♪ After we'd finished touring Black Sea, which was most of 19... the second half of 1980, we were all ready to do something new. It was time to sort of expand the two guitars, bass and drums line-up. Maybe add some piano here and there and just think about, maybe, different guitar textures. So we went in and rehearsed songs for the album that would become English Settlement. Virgin are telling us, \"Yeah, nice material, lads, you don't have a single.\" And so I sat down and tried to write a single. \"Let me see. What's good? What do people want? Like, nursery rhymes. Yeah, it's gotta be a kind of simple melody. Counting's always good.\" That's... ♪ Five, four, three, two, one ♪ ♪ Da-da-da, da-da-da ♪ ♪ Five, four, three, two, one ♪ \"Yeah that was a big hit. Yeah, I can do counting. Well, flip it the other way. One, two, three, four, five. What's about that? What have we got five of? Five legs? No, we don't have five legs. Five arms No, it's four fingers and a thumb. Five senses. Okay. So it's gonna be about your senses. Right. We got where... So it's a counting song.

That's a nice E. ..I threw them on kind of an E-flat place And I didn't throw all my fingers on. I just threw two of them on. I wasn't thinking. And I ended up with that. And I thought, \"Ah, what's that? That's an interesting chord, non-chord.\" I thought, \"Wow. I wonder what that's like if I move my fingers and go the other way as well?\" \"Ooh, that's very nice. This sounds medieval. This is like somebody in a field, tilling. This is a little fella and his ox and he's tilling a field.\" You know. And so I started to sing with the nursery rhyme thing in mind. I thought, \"Well, what would this person tilling the fields be... He'd be singing, ♪ Hey, hey, the clouds are whey ♪ Yeah, I like that. I'm liking that he's looking up at the clouds, you know.\" And so the whole verse was made out of this kind of medieval...

And when I finished a gig one night and went out drinking with some people in Los Angeles, she thought to herself, \"What's he taking this shit for? He doesn't need it. It doesn't do anything for him I'm gonna get rid of him. We're...\" Ooh, Freudian slip! \"I'm gonna get rid of it.\" She tipped all these Valium down the toilet. I came home drunk to this grotty hotel room in Los Angeles. So I'm going in, I'm gonna to need my Valium. \"Where's my Valium?\" She said, \"I've tipped it all away, I don't want you taking this crap anymore. You've gotta stop this stuff.\" I freaked out. I thought, \"Ah, that's my crutch! What are you doing? I take that every day of my life. I've taken that every day since I was 12, 13,\" which I had done. I was on it in the first place because my mother had a lot of mental problems, and the fallout from that was really fucking me up as a kid. Big time. And it was the '60s. And the new wonder drug, Valium! \"Yeah. Oh, his mother's crazy. We're putting her in a loony bin for a while. Poor kid's upset. He's only 12. Tell you what, stick him on Valium.\" I was on Valium, addicted to this stuff since then, and here I am 13 years later, not registering I'm addicted and thinking I can just stop. I had no idea how Valium addiction gets you, and I had no concept of getting off of it. No concept of cold turkey. No concept of, \"This is gonna destroy you if you do it like this.\" So, like two naive idiots, she tipped it all away, and I said, \"Okay. It doesn't do anything for me in any case. Doesn't give me a high, doesn't do anything. What does it do? Nothing. Great. I'm fine. I'm now off of Valium.\" Oh, what a fool. What a pair of fools, you know. Over the following year, I went into slow brain melt. I developed panic attacks. I had no idea what they were. Memory loss. My limbs were seizing up. This was... My whole world was going wrong because of this Valium addiction, coming off of Valium, stopping dead. I didn't think to go to talk to specialists and say, \"How do you do this?\" Since, people have said, \"Hey, you come off of 13 years of Valium addiction, it's worse than heroin, and you try doing cold turkey on heroin.\" I knew he was having these night terrors. I knew that he was very, very nervous. Before every show in the dressing room, you know, he would be so tense, and you'd just think, \"Well, if that's what it takes to get him on stage, then that's what he has to do.\" But you never imagine that it's anything seriously amiss, other than just the natural, you know, tension of stage nerves. We would get to just before the gig and he'd have feelings of being sick and all the rest of it, you know, \"No, I can't go on. I feel sick.\" But it was just... It was just nerves, you know, which manifested itself in a physical, you know, psychosomatic way. Just things came unwound. I was getting agoraphobia, I couldn't go out. I was getting panic attacks. No concept of what panic attack was. And I'm on stage and I'm getting a panic attack. \"Ah! Ah! Why? Why am I afraid of everything in the known universe?\" You know? No concept of what was happening to me. And I found myself going on tour, touring around Europe and then it was a tour of The States, then it would have been Japan, Australia, blah-blah-blah, wherever. Doing this with my brain dribbling out of my skull. All these things going wrong in my mind and in my life, and me not knowing what they are. And I found myself onstage in Paris having the mother of all panic attacks and thinking, \"That's it. I'm going mad. I've got to stop the world. I wanna get off.\" You know. I'm getting all emotional saying this. Yeah... Yeah. \"It's Nearly Africa\" We knew he was unhappy on that particular tour, and when he walked off, immediately we just thought, \"Well, this is Andy being petulant and just doing this to make a point.\" Even when that happened, and I regret this, you know, looking back at it now, we should have paid more attention to what he was... how he was feeling. We just figured, \"Well, let's get him home. Rest for a month. And then we'll go back out when he's all better.\" We'd had this tour set up in America, and we had to get out of town fast, because once the promoters knew that we weren't going to play, you know, they were saying, \"We want a doctor to come round.\" And I remember Andy and I were just packed on a plane, and we shot back to England. But financially, we lost hand over fist, you know, because we weren't sued but we had to pay a good deal of money over in order to pacify the promoters, you know. I probably reacted a bit unsympathetically towards him, I suppose. I was the youngest fella there, and, jeez, you know, to pull out of an American tour is pretty...pretty big stuff. And, yeah, I wasn't aware of... ..like it was like an illness. Like, you know, I wasn't aware of that. I just thought, you know, \"He's just going through a bit of a bad patch and he'll get over it.\" My brother Ian was our agent and their agent, and the first I learned of the stage fright issue was my brother Ian freaking out, saying, \"I can't believe it. We have the best tour. They're starting their tour.\" I think it... Madison Square Garden or something. It was just the tour. \"Boys, you've worked hard. This is your payoff. You've landed.\" And then a phone call from England is that Andy just can't. Won't. The sad bit is I think that he went from not being able to do it to not wanting... Well, that was his story, that he said he didn't want to. I mean, Andy being one for not allowing anything to kind of say he can't do, I think he turned it round a bit, to say, \"Well, I don't want to do.\" But maybe if he'd have got counselling for it, it may have changed things, you know. ♪ I put on a fake smile ♪ ♪ And start the evening show ♪ ♪ The public is laughing ♪ ♪ I guess by now they know ♪ I was just at the end of my tether with everything. I was at the end of my tether with being a performing monkey for management. I was sick of not seeing any money for all of this. In all those years of touring, the band never saw a penny. I know who the villain in all this. I'm not gonna get into all that, 'cause it's too rockumentary. But I know who the villains are. But we never saw any money, and I was sick of that. We never saw any time off to be normal, I was sick of that. Sick of hotels. The whole thing. I was trapped, and I wanted off that treadmill. ♪ Dear Madam Barnum ♪ ♪ I resign as clown ♪ ♪ Dear Madam Barnum ♪ ♪ I resign as clown ♪ ♪ Dear Madam Barnum ♪ I just wanted a normal life. I thought, \"No, I need to get away from this touring crap. If my music's gonna get better, and therefore XTC's music, we need better-quality songs and I need more time to write more and better-quality songs.\" Virgin took it so badly. So badly. Everybody did. You know, the manager. I think the band did, as well. They thought, \"Oh, that's the end of us,\" you know. It got very frustrating for me and for Terry, because we... Well, Terry just loves the road, he loves performing. He loves playing his drums. And me, too. I don't really understand why a musician wouldn't want to work. You know, wouldn't want to go out and tour and play. He never really wanted to pursue the live thing again, you know, which really went against everything I sort of stood for, really. I mean, if you're a musician, to me, playing is what it's all about. Besides that, my sort of circumstances had changed, as well. And my wife was Australian, and we had a small child. So that, on top of the non-touring situation, I thought, \"Well, jeez, you know, maybe it's time for me to move out.\" I totally and utterly felt freed up from stopping live. It was like \"Hey, let's get in the studio and use it for what it is, this creative tool. Let's use every tool in the studio box. We want some brass, we hire a brass player. We want this organ, we just get this organ in. We want Mellotron, let's get a Mellotron. We wanna overdub this, change the speed of that, let's... We can do anything we want, for God's sake. Why were we restricting ourselves to two colors on the palette just so we could do it live? That's insane, fellas. That's not how you grow.\" The arrangements of the songs became more complex. We were able to use strings and stuff without fear of trying to reproduce it on stage. We didn't have that problem. We could go to town, really, you know, and we did. For me, it was wonderful. It was like the blinkers came off. That's live. That's... \"Wow! There are all those other colors! I wanna use them.\" ♪ Awaken, you dreamers ♪ ♪ Adrift in your beds ♪ ♪ Balloons and streamers ♪ ♪ Decorate the ♪ ♪ Inside of your heads ♪ ♪ Please let some out ♪ ♪ Do it today ♪ ♪ But don't let the loveless ones ♪ ♪ Sell you a world wrapped in gray ♪ ♪ Da, da ♪ ♪ Da, da, hm ♪ How I wrote a lot of the songs is I'll find a chord or a chord change on a guitar, or on a keyboard, and I'm playing those, but I'm not hearing music. I'm seeing pictures. That's how I write songs. It comes, usually, from the synesthesic level. Synesthesia is where you get stuff mixed up. Someone will say a number and you'll hear a noise. Or someone will show you a color and you'll think of a number. Or you'll hear a piece of music or a chord, and, to me, it makes a picture. I'm gonna just see if I can do the exercise live, as it were. Let me find a chord that I've never played in my life. Let me see. No, that's a bit rotten. Ooh. You see, that, to me, suggests a pool of... Like a puddle. Like a pool of muddy water. [continues to play guitar chords] So if was working from the synesthesia point, the song would have to be involving this muddy water in some way. I've never done this before in my life. Okay, so it's... Not this song, or what I'm about to sing or anything, or say, or the words or anything, but... ♪ There is the muddiest of water ♪ ♪ There is the deepest of pools ♪ So, to me, it suggests... That's a lovely chord, actually. I'm not gonna forget that. But that's... I have no idea what that chord is called, I've never played it before, but it suggests muddy water. That's how I write songs. It comes usually from the synesthesic thing. \"Love On A Farmboy's Wages\" I wrote this song, Love On A Farmboy's Wages, sort of about the romance of my grandfather, and, to some extent, my father working on farms. I mean, they had terrible lives on these farms. I was just messing around with a note of E and... \"Oh, yeah. That's nice. That's like the countryside. You know, we're on the farm.\" ♪ Tonight, when my work is done ♪ It's so important that you paint the musical scenery, to me. Then you can find the right lines for the actors to say.

And the scene was changing, so we were... It was kind of the wilderness years for us, you know, just for two or three years. There's a long tradition of whatever media you're in, writers do it all the time, but musicians do it, as well, where you wanna not be you.

We just put ourselves in the mind-set of bands from the mid-'60s, and just find as much vintage gear as we can, so we can get it sounding as authentic as possible. It was very relaxing for the band, because there was no pressure on them to be here. There was no pressure to do a hit single. And it was all their fantasies in making music, to be psychedelic. ♪ ..thirty-four ♪ It was very good fun, and it did surprisingly well. The Dukes probably sold more than The Big Express , which was the XTC album of around that time. Of course, it was all meant to be hush, hush, \"Don't tell anyone it's XTC.\" Everyone loved it. And people still do today, you know. When I met The Stone Roses and they asked me to do their record, they kind of said, \"You are the John Leckie that did the Dukes Of Stratosphear, aren't you?\" And I went, \"Yeah, yeah.\" And they said, \"Oh, 'cause that's why we asked you. We loved that record.\" Dukes of Stratosphear was probably a direct predecessor to Britpop. Creating that sort of psychedelic '60s-influenced music was, yeah, very unusual for the time. I think that album came out in the early-'80s or something, so that record was, yeah, definitely a precursor to Britpop, for sure. It opened us up to a new audience. It was a lot of kids that were sort of starting to get into... Well, they were calling it, like, a Paisley Underground, or, you know, whatever. It was this new feeling of, \"Hey, maybe '60s music is okay.\" And I think it gave us the feeling that we could tap into what we liked as schoolkids. I think we all felt more comfortable in ourselves, and we felt more comfortable in being this bridge from the '60s to the '80s. And hey, that's fine, you know. This is why... We were then at that point where it was like, \"We're not gonna deny any of our influences anymore, we're just gonna let them all free.\" ♪ Season cycle moving round and round ♪ ♪ Pushing life up from a cold, dead ground ♪ ♪ It's growing green ♪ ♪ It's growing green ♪ ♪ Well, darling, don't you ever stop to wonder ♪ ♪ About the clouds, about the hail and thunder? ♪ ♪ About the baby and its umbilical? ♪ ♪ Who's pushing the pedals on the season cycle? ♪ By the time we had got to making the Skylarking album which I think personally is the next Dukes record, Virgin really wanted us to break big in The States and did actually say, \"If you don't let an American produce your next album-to-be, you're off the label, because you are not selling enough records in America.\" And they said, \"You're gonna need a US producer, somebody who knows what Americans like and can find that in your music.\" 'Cause I thought our music was pretty British. \"Okay, good luck.\" And they sent me a list of all these producers. You know, Arnie Dinkelberger IX, and Ronnie Dangleheimer XIV, and all that. I didn't know who all these people were. I'd never heard of them. So right near the bottom of this list was Todd Rundgren. I thought, \"Ah! I know who he is. I had an album of his one time. He's American. Yeah. Right, oh, okay. So he produces, does he? Alright, well, that might be fun. He's a musician. He knows what musicians are about.\" And I said to Dave, \"You know Todd Rundgren, right?\" \"Todd? Yeah, I'm a big fan. Of course I am.\" \"Well, how would you think if he produced an album?\" \"Yeah, let's go for it.\" I was in my element. I couldn't believe it.

And Andy likes his pound of flesh when you're recording with him. If you haven't done six or seven takes, and he's wrung everything out of you, then he's not had a good time, you know. Whereas Todd likes first or second take, otherwise forget it, you know. It was just two different philosophies had met. I have a problem with authority. \"And this is my band and you're not telling us what to do.\" But all the time this ghost voice saying, \"If you don't be produced by an American, you're off the label.\" So I just had to bear it as much as possible. I would have liked Andy and Todd to have seen eye-to-eye and got along as friends, but, you know, you've got the irresistible force and the immovable object. That's really what the problem was. But Todd did the job he was given, you know: he produced a record. It was a hit record. It saved our career. No question about it. ♪ Laying on the grass ♪ ♪ My heart, it flares like fire ♪ ♪ The way you slap my face ♪ ♪ Just fills me with desire ♪ In The States, they put the single out, Grass, which is a Colin song, then on the B-side they stuck Dear God.

Take this trash out of here, this English homo and his anti-God music,\" you know. Some stations were threatened with bombing and stopped playing it. Some kid in an American school was so affected by it, he took his teacher hostage with a knife and insisted this record be played over the school PA system to all the classrooms continuously until this hostage situation ended. Because this record said... It spoke for what he wanted to say. And I got a hell of a lot of hate mail for that. I was gonna burn in hell, And I was just a god-dang limey faggot. Well, it's ironic that that song broke them through. Any record company worth its salt, which none of them are, by the way, would have said, \"Well, you know, that's great for England, but don't try that in The States. We're a God-fearing country.

And it plugged me straight into the sort of pop art vibe. We were working in Hollywood. It's a big Hollywood production. And it sounds that way. It's got bells, it's got whistles. And we had plenty of time, you know. Again, you see, five months in a studio, there's an awful lot you can do. We probably did a little too much on one or two of the songs, but again, it's a great album. A really great collection of songs. And I can say that as a non-song-writer, I can say that in all modesty, 'cause I had nothing to do with the actual writing process. Quite a lot to do with the arrangements and the overdubs.

It's just a real shame that Dave Gregory didn't stick around for the end of that. He left during the making of that, and it's... It is bad when you have a limb detach itself.

It works really good! \"This is even better than the first leg, thanks!\" And then, you know, Terry leaves \"Ah!\" So we use session drummers, but some of those session drummers were certainly different than Terry, so that was an added bonus to that. Then Dave left, and I don't know if we ever recovered from that. But, you know, for a band, we had a hell of a long life, and most bands get five years if they're lucky. We had 30-odd years. The legacy of the band is the great music that they made. You know, they evolved as musicians and as composers, and sure, from their beginnings to how they wound up at the end, there was a strong evolution of a great band. I love the fact that they were kind of willfully unpredictable, but commercially, that's something that actually is suicidal. You know, how can you market a band where it's very hard to get handle on what kind of band they are? And I think that's always been one of the problems they've had. But to me, it just made me love them even more. They have got a reputation as not being well-known or credited as much as they should. But I think that XTC fans would be annoyed if they were more well-known, because it's our little secret, I think, with that band, and I kinda like that. ♪ Please to bend down for the one called the Greenman ♪ To me, people who know what they're talking about already do regard them as up there with the greats.

They're waiting on your arrival. - What did I tell you about interrupting me, General Sherwood? - [Sherwood] My apologies sir, but the chiefs request your counsel at once. The situation in Ananaki has destabilized to the point of war. - War? Yes well, I'm taking a solo flight to clear my head. - A flight? Now? Sir, I strongly suggest. - You can suggest all you like Grace, Premiers need a break too. Consider this a little me time. After all, I've maintained peace in this mercurial galaxy since taking office. Have I not? - [Sherwood] Well, yes. - It's settled then. Tell the chiefs I'll return before the next sun rotation. - [Sherwood] And what shall I tell the rebels fighting on Ananaki? - Tell them to handle their business. Were they not so hotheaded we wouldn't be in this mess. (explosion) (Premier grunting) - [Sherwood] Premier Sylus? Premier Sylus? - I'm hit, and I'm going down. I'm gonna crash! - Mr. Premier, are you there? Can you hear me? (ominous music) - I don't suppose there's a repair shop around here. (dark music) Uh, oh. - He what? Crashed where? Is he alive? - We don't know. The tracking device in his cruiser came to a sudden stop on the western rim of Mars. It's still active but hasn't moved. - What are we waiting for? He could be injured in the wreckage. We need to get out there right now. - You read my mind, Guy. I'm routing us to the location now. - No you're not, General. If the Premier's dead, the last thing we need to do is put you in harm's way. You're his successor, and this galaxy could erupt in war at any minute. It needs a voice of reason. - I'm going with you. It's my call. - It's a bad one. I'm going alone, and I'll take the Beetle. - I could court martial you for dereliction of duty. - Wouldn't be the first time. I'll radio when I'm onsite. Keep the home fire burning till we get back. - Watch your back out there, Guy. - Always. (upbeat electronic music) I'm at the ship, General. I don't think Sylus made it but I don't see a body. - [Grace] Keep looking till you're sure. I don't care if all you find is a finger, we have to know. - Copy. This ground is like Swiss cheese, but that, that looks like a cave. Good thing I brought my spelunking gear. (upbeat electronic music) Premier? Premier Sylus, are you down here? Damn it. No body, no blood. Where are you? Bad news and good news, Grace. - Give me the bad news. - I didn't find him. - And the good news? - I didn't find him. - Fair enough. We'll keep searching. - Not far and wide. I don't think he made it off that rock, General. The surface is porous and riddled with subterranean catacombs. He could be anywhere but I think he is there. - What do you suggest? - The sun's just rotated away from Mars. That gives us close to 10 hours of darkness. I want permission to try a rescue. - You got it. How many men do you need? - Just one. - One? Who is it? - Thanks for joining us today, Foot. Your muscle's appreciated. This prison might be the highest security facility in the star system, but this robot is no ordinary prisoner. - Sergeant Fox is right, Bigfoot. The cyborg's dangerous and that's putting it lightly. - We'll be all right. Danger's my middle name. I got your backs. - Stay alert, men. That door up ahead is our last security checkpoint before we enter the holding cells. After that we're on our own. - You mean I can't count on all these little dudes with their pea shooters? - No. - Good. - Hmm. - [Grace] Don't try anything, stupid Cyborg. - Call me X. Why are we talking? - We have a deal to offer you. About an hour ago, small spacecraft went down on the surface of Mars. The Premier was on board. - So, reschedule the Premier. - [Grace] That's not funny, Cyborg. - Premier Sylus has been almost single-handedly responsible for keeping the balance of peace since the Great Intergalactic War. His loss is a huge blow to the stability of the Ananaki region. - [Cyborg] So what do you want me to do? Scrape up his remains and give him a proper burial? - Smart mouth on this here metal head. - [Cyborg] Who's the Muppet? - Muppet? Tin man, I'll break your ass. - [Cyborg] I'm right here. - Enough, both of you. - I've already visited the crash site. There was no body. We believe the Premier is alive, somewhere. - [Cyborg] Somewhere, huh? What's in it for me? - Simply put, survival. You're set to be crushed for your crimes. You've reached the end of the line. - Go to Mars, find the Premier. Bring him back in 24 hours and you're free bot. What do you say? - Get a new Premier. - Our galaxy's on the brink of another war, Cyborg. A peace summit was scheduled to take place with rebel forces in the Ananaki system. - But the ceasefire expires in 24 hours. The fighting will intensify, and almost certainly spread like wildfire throughout the cosmos. - [Cyborg] Mass destruction? I like it. - Let me at let this chill. I'll crush him myself. - Bring it on, neanderthal. - Why you son of a- - Listen, our survival depends on this. We nearly went extinct once. We don't wanna play with that fire again. - There are nuclear weapons in play. If we don't locate the Premier so that he can calm down the chaos in Ananaki, we fear a space detonation could open a black hole and swallow all life as we know it. - [Guy] You perish one way or the other. Take the deal, you survive. What's it gonna be, Robot? - Call me X. - I'm known as quantum. I'm here to brief you before you take off, Xterminator. - Call me X. - Very well, X. You can track and locate the Premier through his vital signs, using a special heat sensitive device our lab has created for the job. Premier Sylus is reptilian so his body temperature changes constantly to match his surroundings, making traditional methods of tracking quite difficult. - I always knew politicians were snakes. - That's funny. I'll relay it to the General. She may laugh. - You do that, Quantum. Where am I landing? - Not on the planet's surface directly, I'm afraid. Forces there may anticipate another visit, rendering such a direct approach perilous. I'm told this is our best and last chance to recover the Premier, and General Sherwood wishes to minimize the risk. Instead, you'll fly to our space station near the Mars orbit. From there you'll board a motorless pod and make quiet entry. - What about radar, camera surveillance, surface missiles? - The pod's invisible to radar detection, and once in motion, travels one half second faster than the speed of light, effectively evading all known visual surveillance technology. As for weaponry, the pod boasts built in projectile detection. If fired upon by most traditional methods, it can automatically redirect its own trajectory, twice. - What if it's fired on three times? - Three times, you're on your own. - Comforting. - Once you land, you'll find a surface rover for your use only. Use the retina scanner to start its engine. The mission room is next. Come see the rest of your gear. - Who are the butt brains? - Security. With the weaponized technology housed in this wing, no one has clearance to be here alone, not even me. - Hmm, humans and their trust issues. - You might say that, but General Sherwood's methods have minimized errors to a negligible percentile. The surface of Mars receives precipitation. Consequently, there are scattered bodies of water resulting in thriving subterranean cavern systems, as reported by Sergeant Fawkes following his initial exploration. There's also a power source underground, but no generators in sight. We suspect the creators have harnessed natural energy by tapping the planet's core. - Sounds like the humans could learn a thing or two. - Indeed, X. They're already experimenting with sustainable methods, should war ensue, and once again, destabilize the galaxy. Our last stop is the lab, come. Just step up on the platform X, and our briefing will conclude. - Why do I have to step on a platform? - Formality. I'm going to inject you with a system stabilizer that staves off malicious virus contraction for 24 hours. - I don't like needles. - Hmm. Yes. Whether mortal or AI, few do. Up you go. - Make it quick. - [Quantum] That's it. - Feels glitchy. - Merely the upload, it'll pass before your departure. - It had better or else. - I see why Sergeant Fawkes enlisted you. Your spaceship is waiting. (dramatic music) - [Guy] There it goes. The Xterminator's lifted off. You think it'll stick to the plan? - It has no choice. If it doesn't, we'll hit the button and shut it off. Why don't we have a little fun and let it know what those injections really were. - Is that smart? - What are its options? Turn around and come get us? The knowledge will only make that cyborg work harder and faster to find Premier Sylus. You should know how this works, Guy. Once the Premier's safe and sound, we destroy the cyborg anyway. Come in, Cyborg. Cyborg. Cyborg, what are you doing? - I'm talking my vessel in your space station sweetheart. - Well, quite the vocabulary. How far out are you? - In sight, I'll make entry soon. - This conversation feels strange. - Maybe you should get your mind out of the proverbial gutter, General. - Amusing, for a hunk of self-actualized AI. - A hunk, me? General, if I didn't know better, I'd say you had a crush. - You oughta know better. I want to tell you something before you reach the station. - Tell me what? - That idea you had about turning the ship around 180 degrees and flying off to planet Kerr. Not gonna happen. See, we snuck in a little insurance policy. The injection you received in our lab wasn't to ward off viruses. It implanted one. - What? - That's right, Cyborg. You're infected with one of our designer weaponized viruses. The worm's already multiplying, bonding to your memory and all backups. In 22 hours you'll go into complete system failure. Total hard disc erasure. You'll crash and burn, unless. - Unless what, you lying swine? - Unless you return Premier Sylus to us on time and in one piece. Do that and we'll run the antiviral program that completely eradicates the infection. Try to escape or not get the job done, you're back to a death sentence. - When I get back, I'm going to kill you. - See you soon, Cyborg. - You're not concerned about that? - Guy, do you have any idea how many times I've been threatened in my lifetime? - This is a little bit different, it's the Xterminator. - It's all the same. A threat's a threat, and no bot's gonna stop me, ever. - Those no good rotten conniving disease-riddled humans think they've outsmarted me. My AI programming runs circles around their fully developed brains at three months. Let them have their tricks, their games, and their cons. When they're soft necks are in my cold steel grasps, their laughter will be replaced by tearful please for mercy, and there shall be none. Impressive space station the humans have built. When this is over and my titanium is drenched in their warm blood, I'll wash off here, and then rip their impressive station apart, pole by pole. (light music) - Well, if it isn't the lovely and vivacious General Sherwood? To, what do we owe the distinct pleasure, hmm? - Save the flowery epithets, warden. You know who I'm here to see, and you're not doing his mental health any favors by keeping him in complete isolation. Buzz me in. (door buzzing) It's been a long time, Megalodon. We meet again. - We have to stop running into each other in places like this, General. I'd much rather see you in the open sea where no electric barriers can keep us apart. - I'm sure you would, but we'll have to settle for this. - Bummer. - I wanted to talk to you. I have a deal you may be interested in. - I'm listening. - I want you to do something for me. A space cruiser crashed on Mars. We believe it was shot down. Premier Sylus was on board. - Am I supposed to know who that is? - Just that he's very important to our galaxy. He's a peacekeeper, and they're in short supply since the great intergalactic war. The Premier's missing and we want him back. - And you want me to find him? What will you do for me General? - Return the Premier to us safely and I'll set you free. (Megalodon laughing) - Who would sign off on that? - No one in their right mind. But I can initiate a transfer, and can have the guard stand down while you conveniently escape. - And when the shark hunt is on, am I to spend the rest of my days looking over my dorsal fin? - It'll be a dragnet on paper only, no one will hunt you. Then I'll transport you to Planet Shirah, where you'll live off the galactic grid. You can take it over for all I care. The only caveat is that you never show your teeth in our neck of the cosmos again. - Hmm. Why me? - [Grace] You're the most destructive creature I could think of. And there are perils involved. The Xterminator is also looking for Premier Sylus. - The Xterminator? Then why do you need me? - Because I don't like or trust the cyborg. His involvement was my sergeant's idea, and I think it was a mistake. I want Xterminator out of the picture permanently. - That's a tall order, General. I want more than exile. I want my minions back. - Done. Your team of science bots are still in my employ. Find the Premier, destroy the Xterminator and I'll return them to you. Do we have a deal? - You're desperate. - I'm motivated. Are you? - Yes. (tense music) - [Warden] General Sherwood, can I have a word? - What is it? (warden laughing) - [Warden] You are aware that conversations are monitored here, yes? - What's your point? - [Warden] Well, did I hear you correct? Did you just offer to spring the Megalodon from prison? - No, it wasn't an offer. It was a statement of fact. I'm borrowing the Mag for a while, and if he fulfills his end of the bargain, I'm taking him off your hands, for good. Your guard staff should breathe the sigh of relief. - [Warden] Yes, well I, I wasn't consulted. - Because I don't need to. I know what you do around here, warden. And if you want me to continue looking the other way, you'll do as I say. The transfer papers will be on your desk in an hour. Have the Mag ready? - [Warden] Yes ma'am, don't worry about a thing. Nothing at all. - This thing moves fast for being motorless. When I murder that double-talking general, I'll have to remember to come back for it. (craft falling) This planet's a dust bowl. I can't see clearly beyond 10 yards. The Premier could be standing right in front of me and I wouldn't know it. I see no signs of life anywhere. Must find an entrance to those caverns the humans spoke of. That's got to be where I'll find him, dead or alive. (land rover running) - This is really outta left field Johnson, and the break of dawn? It's early for a move like this. - The general must want to keep it a secret. - Yeah, but why? What's going on? - Beats me. I guess it's need to know and we don't need to know. - Chicks. (both laughing) - Who has got the call, Behram? - Holmes and Johnson should be waiting at the next stop. - Holmes, I hate that guy. - You and everybody else. Good team lead though, gets the job done. - Whatever man. I could use a triple stacked breakfast sandwich from Space Jack's. You in? - We're on a tight schedule, Ramirez. - We're gonna pass right by at the corner of 53rd. I'll buy. - We gotta make it quick. - Mm-mm. Space Jack's makes the best breakfast sandwiches. - You guys got Space Jack's? Mm. - Anyone know why we're moving the Megalodon? - No clue. I even reread the text three times, thought it had to be a screw up. - You're not the only one. I actually checked the calendar to see if it was April Fool's day. - Doesn't matter why we're doing it. They have a reason. We've got to draw. We gotta keep our heads on a swivel and work snug. No room for errors. - Behram's right. Any slipups, no matter how slight, and the Meg could get loose. We can hardly afford to blink. - That's reassuring. - Good day, gentleman. - No chit chat Shark. Turn around and face the wall. Fins behind your back. - Are we going somewhere? - You're in for a transfer, you're coming with us. - Wonderful. I can't wait to get some fresh air. - We what? Why the hell would we do that? - I'm with Guy. Has the Meg ever had a move where he didn't attempt to escape? - Attempting and doing are two different things, Wrathchild. The shark's never fled custody, and never will. - I don't know, Grace, it seems mighty risky. Especially with the Xterminator on the loose. - It's not on the loose, Foot. It's working for us. It's under our boots and when it's finished, we'll stamp it out just like it's sentencing would call for. - But why couldn't we at least wait until the X came back in? It's only 24 hours. - Like I said, we detected security risks when we went to talk to the Xterminator. I decided we're better safe than sorry, so I signed the transfer papers and sent in the team. - May I ask who's handling it? - Holmes, Johnson, Behram and Ramirez. - Ramirez? You've gotta be kidding me. He was court martialed last year. He's dirtier than Foot's toes. - He watch it now. - I've kept a close tab on Ramirez. He's been squeaky clean. There's no cause for concern. - Where's the Meg being taken? - [Grace] Our new maximum security facility in the Devonian realm. A chartered plane's transporting him to the launchpad now. - [Guy] Shackled and muzzled I presume. - And at gun point. - Don't worry, the shark will have eyes on him every second. Now, let's get down to business. Any word from the Xterminator? - Damn this infernal wasteland. I must have combed a hundred miles. - Xterminator, come in. - I'm in the rover Fawkes, but I see no signs of life anywhere. - Keep looking. The Premier's got to be there. - I think your man's dead sergeant. Either he was obliterated in the crash, or somebody's had him for dinner. - Then find that somebody. If we can't find Premier Sylus, we need answers, for the sake of the galaxy. - Hang on, I see something a few yards up ahead. - Approach with caution, Cyborg. It could be a trap. - Thanks. - [Grace] Talk to us, Cyborg. What do you see? Cyborg. Cyborg. - It turned you off, General. - Ha. - [Grace] It's not funny, Foot. (Guy laughing) - Do you come in peace, traveler? - If I don't, you'll live in peaces alien. - But this is my home. That makes you the alien. Whatever you are. - Who are you? - My name is Penru, a member of the Byair tribe. - Where are the others? - Around. They only allow themselves to be seen when they wish. - So they're underground. - What gives you that idea? - I heard about the caverns. - Ah, the spelunker. We monitored him closely. Our elders deemed his visit harmless, more curious than hostile. So we allowed him to go on his way. - Your elders are fools. Never trust a human. - I, I thought I knew your face. Wow, the Xterminator. I thought they dismantled you. What are you doing on Mars? - Looking for somebody. - Oh. Who? - The Premier. - Oh, the crash landing. - That's right. Take me to him and I'll let you live. - My kind harbor's no ill will toward you Xterminator. - Call me X. I need a guide and I want to see the caverns, and I want the Premier. - I'd show you the catacombs as you request X but, you won't find the Premier there. - Where then? - About five miles east of here. I can provide coordinates if you like. - Tell me and beat it. We have nothing else to discuss. - I should tell you, there is a colony base out there. A single human who came in peace and won over our elders. He calls himself Woody. - [X] Does he harbor the Premier? - [Penru] He does not. He lives off the grid, avoids other humans. I suspect he had a bad time of it on earth. He will likely try to befriend you. - I don't do friends. I'll collect Premier Sylus and I'll be on my way. (tense music) - Now, you just stay put right where you are Meg. We're watching your every move. There's nowhere to run and no way out, so just relax and enjoy the ride. - Oh I plan to, baits. I plan to. - You know we thought you'd be more reluctant to fly, being an aquatic animal and all. - It's not flying that concerns me, plankton. It's crashing. - Yeah, join the club. And just to put your mind at ease, we are all top tier engineers and mechanics, and the flight crew are decorated veterans. Our planes don't crash. Besides, Johnson here set down a Cessna in his rookie year. - From 14,000 feet, nose dive for the last two, straight down. - And it doesn't happen twice, so there's nothing to worry about. We'll reach the launch pad within the hour, then off you go. - Sounds fun, chum. It's been very nice chatting with you morsels. Since our time together is almost up, I think I'll quite miss our repartee. - [Ramirez] Maybe we'll visit you sometime. - I doubt it. I highly doubt it. - Who's up for shots? I'm gonna raid the galley. - [Johnson] See if we have any crown. If not, Jack'll do. - Gotcha. (explosion) - What was that? - Engine two just blew. Captain, pressure is dropping fast. - [Johnson] What? (Megalodon laughing) - [Behram] We're going down, we're gonna crash. - [Johnson] Is everyone okay? - [Ramirez] I'm here, and I snagged a fifth of Crown. You want a hit Johnson? - [Johnson] Where's the Meg? Does anyone see the Meg? Where's Holmes? Holmes! (Holmes groaning) - Guys, guys, I can't feel my legs, can't move. The water. Water's rising. - [Johnson] Outta the water everyone, that shark could be loose. Shit, climb onto the plane if you can. - The stashed an escape cruiser, just like they promised. Let's see how she handles. (tense music) - That bubble-headed alien better not have sent me on a wild goose chase. Lest I return and slaughter her whole species, saving her for last. That rotten alien, that no good swine. They killed him and picked his bones clean. They killed the Premier. There goes my last bargaining chip. The mortals have no reasons to keep their word to me now. The only way out is to get my hands on their antivirus, and kill them all. - General, we just got a report from the tower. The plane transporting the Megalodon has dropped off the radar. - What do you mean it's dropped off the radar? - They were cruising at altitude and something happened. The aircraft dipped 5,000 feet in less than 10 seconds before radar lost it. - They crashed? - We're tapping the area's surveillance drone now, we should know shortly. I told you moving the Meg was a bad idea, Grace. - You don't make the decisions around here, Guy. - Maybe I should. - Yeah? And just how do you plan to do that, Sergeant? - I think you need some time off. Your methods are becoming unsound. - My methods are none of your goddamn business. - I beg to differ. - General Sherwood, drone four is showing aerial footage from the site. It doesn't look good. - They went down in the water. Do we have communication? Is anyone alive? - There's been no reply, I'm afraid. I fear the flight crews in grave danger. - Damn it all. They shouldn't be in this mess. We may have lost a whole crew, and unleashed the Megalodon into the cosmos. - We'll finish this conversation later, Sergeant. Send a rescue vessel right away, Bort. Round up as many of our people as possible, and issue an immediate intergalactic KBB on the Meg. Unless he's in pieces on the ocean floor, I want that shark found. (upbeat music) - To be free. I nearly forgot what the galaxy smells like. I don't know what I'd rather do more. Tear the Xterminator limb from limb, or return the Premier with one less leg. I guess I'll make up for the lost time and do both. (laughing) - Hi there, welcome to my new Mars colony. I come in peace with respect to all species and cultures. Would you like a hot tamale? (Woody screaming) (slashing) - The humans are so easy to butcher, like lambs to the slaughter. If I had taste buds, I'm sure they'd be delectable. This vessel is quite comfortable. Those lying pigs expecting me to sit in the Mars dust, and call them for pickup like a ride share. They won't expect this. I'll drop the Premier's bones at their quaking feet, then send them to join him in whatever hell roasts his reptilian soul. But first, the antivirus. - [Grace] Lying down on the job, Guy? - Just getting a little chiropractic adjustment, General. I hold all my job stress in my neck and shoulders. - There's no need to stress. We're handling our business. - Is that what you call it? The Xterminator and the Megalodon are on the loose. Premier Sylus is missing or dead, and the galaxy's about to go to war again. Okay. - Dr. Moreau, may we have some privacy? - I'm not sure I want privacy with the General, Doc. - It's not a request Sergeant, it's an order. - Fritz is performing electric stimulation therapy on Sergeant Fawkes, General. Interrupting will negate its benefits. May he remain to monitor the Sergeant's vitals? - Sure. Fritz's brain is fried like an egg anyway. All he hears and sees is blips and code. He can continue. We'll call you when we're finished, Dr. Moreau. - As you wish, General. - I fear we've gotten off track regarding our duties, Guy. I wanted to talk about that. - Do we have to do this now? Fritz, can I sit up? - Certainly Sergeant. You'll be finished in a moment. - Thanks. General, I don't know what's going on with you lately, but your judgment's not what it should be. Moving the Meg was stupid, and it bit us on the ass like I said it would. - You sprung the Xterminator from decommissioned row. I sprung the Meg from prison. Seems like we're even. - This isn't a contest, Grace. The survival of the galaxy hangs in the balance. - I've been doing this longer than you have, Sergeant, and I have rank. You're welcome to your opinion, but we do things my way. - You've made that abundantly clear. - Have I? If you're intent on pulling in another direction, we could discuss reassignment. - [Guy] Or we could go before the judges tribunal and see what they think. - Are you threatening me? - I'm just saying, we have options. - Well, in that case, try this one. Fritz? (beeping) (Guy grunting) That looks like it hurts. What number is that Fritz? - Number 11, General Sherwood. - 11? That can't feel good. It was set to what, two? - Yes, madam. - That'll teach you to challenge my authority, Guy. And unfortunately reassignment's no longer on the table. Your duty ends here. Thank you for your service. Fritz. (ominous music) - What have we here? A launcher coming from Mars? Who might you be? Attention pilot. Identify yourself or prepare to be blasted from the stars. - Blast from the stars? Just try it, space rogue. You offend a war machine. - Ah, the Xterminator. I suspected it was you but I heard you were dismantled. - You and everybody else. Who am I speaking with? - It's me, Robot. The one and only Megalodon. - Meg? I thought your voice sounded familiar. I heard you were serving 12 life sentences in a human gulag. - Yes, but you know the mortals, always looking to cut a deal. - Indeed, what did they promise you? - [Megalodon] My freedom. - [X] In exchange for? - In exchange for destroying you. (explosion) - Damn. - So in closing, I'd like to reiterate that Sergeant Guy Fawkes exemplified the very best of what we all strive to be. His honor, bravery, and utter selflessness in combat and duress are traits we can all learn from. May he rest in peace. Bort, if you would, open the airlock and send our good Sergeant to his final frontier. - As you command, General Sherwood. (beeping) - What in the stars happened, Fritz? The sergeant was perfectly fine when I left. And now this? - It's quite inexplicable, Doctor. One moment he was fine and the next he was no more. - Did something go wrong with our systems? Did he say anything? Did he suffer. - Negative. We concluded the electric stimulation session and suddenly he collapsed. I rushed to his aid but he flat-lined almost immediately. And revival proved unsuccessful. - It makes no sense. It's fantastic. - Is it a bad time? - General Sherwood, I'm beside myself. There's no good explanation for what happened. - We're all shaken, Doctor. But if I know one thing, it's that Guy would want us to carry on for our own sakes. - I'd like to conduct a thorough autopsy myself, if that is all right. - That won't be necessary, Dr. Moreau. The Sergeant's already been laid to rest. - Laid to rest? - Per his wishes. We discussed it quite often. He was adamant that we not pause in his memory, but remain vigilant on all fronts. - Where is the body if I may ask? - Jettisoned into deep space. The stars are where Guy was happiest. It's only fitting that he spend eternity among them. - I see, I, I don't know what to say. - There's nothing to say, Doctor. Just resume your work, for Guy. Bigfoot, come in. Are you there? - I'm here, lady. I mean, General. What's up? - With the unfortunate passing of Sergeant Fawkes, I have an offer for you. - Huh? Some Sasquatches dream of a call like this. Talk to me. - You've been a reliable soldier for us since the day you joined our team. How would you like to be ranked? - Ranked? You talking about size? 'Cause you know I'm pretty confident. - I have no doubt, but I'm not talking about size. I want you to do something for me, right now. - Damn, well since you put it like that. - I've given you level A clearance, effective immediately. I want you to direct an alpha crash override on the Rune prison planet at once. - An alpha override, but, but, that'll crash the power grid. The prison will be unsecured, wide open like a playground for the galaxy's biggest lunatics. - Are you disobeying a direct order, Foot? Because I can just as easily strip you of your rank and court martial your furry ass. - Well, since you put it that way. (prisoners shouting) (gates opening) (implements clanging) (monster roaring) - Going somewhere? (laughing) - Oh, this baby's got some horsepower. Finders keepers. It's time to make the friendly skies spookier. Come on gang, let's fly. (laughing) Woo, what's this button do? (explosion) (monster laughing) I'm free to do what I want any old time. - Code red, all prisoners have escaped. I repeat, all prisoners have escaped. (monster laughing) - What have we here? Are you seeing this, Cosgo? (Cosgo growling) (explosion) - Looks like our dance will have to wait, Xterminator. Someone's cutting in. - What? Who are these clowns? - Mind your tongue, wind up toy. And this universe is full of clowns, but I'm the baddest. (laughing) (explosion) - No time for this. (explosions) - Hot damn. Looks like war's unavoidable. This whole galaxy gonna pop like a pinata with these crackpots in charge. Why can't we all just get along? I think it's high time I got outta here for a while. Back to nature, back to my roots, 'sides, a little hibernation does a Sasquatch good. Maybe I'll wake up, maybe I won't. Maybe I'll just sit there for a while, see what happens. (wind blowing) - Damn it. I thought a galactic riot would be good for us, provide distraction and cover for the cyborg to get his titanium ass back here. Now it's caught in the middle of a space melee. Cyborg, what is going on out there? - I'm indisposed at the moment. Hit me up later. - Is the Premier with you? - Yes. - [Grace] Thank Heavens. Are you coming back to headquarters? - That's the idea. We'll see how it goes. - We've got your back Cyborg. Our laser shields are up, but we can't help you in the middle of that dog fight. You have to get to our sector eight loading hanger. - You mean you can't reel me in? - No. - Good. - Just bring the Premier back in one piece, Cyborg. - One piece, huh? You got it. - General Sherwood, rebel forces are once again clashing in the Ananaki system. Armadas have mobilized between planet Earth and Mars. They're in a standoff. We're moments away from intergalactic war. - Listen to me, Bort. Premier Sylus will be here shortly. - The Premier's alive. That's fantastic news. - We have to stall. A few minutes are all we need for the Premier to address the fighting. Gather the news media for a live broadcast, galaxy wide. Galaxy wide. (tense music) - Going somewhere, X. - The antivirus. - Thought you'd never ask. Right this way. That's it. (dramatic music) The General's ordered an immediate live media conference, X. I understand Premier Sylus is with you. - He is. - Wonderful, he's to address the galaxy at once. Where is he? - Nearby, he's ready when you are. But I have one question. - Of course. Anything you want, just name it. - I'd like to introduce the Premier. - Introduce the Premier? Certainly. Between us, it's a deft move. It will redraft public perception of you. You may even find yourself with a new press secretary job. - Hmm. We'll see. - We're about to go live. Is the Premier here? (beeping) - We're live in three, two, one, you're on. - Greetings. You all know me, who I am and what I do. Recently I found myself apprehended, facing this galaxy's harshest penalty. I'm sure some of you would be glad to see me smelted into a silvery puddle. Alas, the humans offered a deal, as humans do. And having no other recourse, I accepted. Now, as I stand here before the universe, I fulfilled my end of the bargain. And much to my surprise, the humans have fulfilled theirs. - Clock's ticking. Cut to the chase, Cyborg. - I understand the cosmos now teeters on the brink of war, something I know only too well. I love the screams of the damned, and the smell of charred enemies. And I especially love the looks on idealistic faces when they realize, despite their naive yearnings, that there is no hope. - Jesus Christ. Bort, tell the Cyborg to wrap it up, or cut this live feed and rejoin when the Premier appears. - Understood, General. - Flesh and blood life is fleeting, meaningless. You all strive, toil, suffer, and ultimately die. And despite it all, your best efforts are mocked and forgotten even before your rancid corpses rots. - Time, Xterminator. Introduce Premier Sylus, please. - Well, it looks like our time's up, as was the Premier's, as yours soon shall be. Without further ado, I give you, your beloved Premier Sylus. (eerie music) - [Grace] Cutaway Bort, cutaway. (people shouting) (light jazz music) - [Voice On Radio] Central, commencing perimeter search. - Well, well, if it isn't my good friend, General Sherwood, how's your galaxy? - Better by the minute since we took you back into custody. And don't worry, our Cosmos Commando Team is busy rounding up the escaped prisoners as we speak. At the rate they're going, Every one of those monsters should be apprehended by sunrise. - You there, halt. Do not move, hands where I can see 'em. Shut out that light and get your on the ground, or I will shoot you where you stand. - Shoot me? What about due process, Officer? Last I checked, it wasn't illegal for a jack-o-lantern to have a good time. (laughing) - Well aren't you special, General. - Your words, not mine. That was quite a stunt you pulled at headquarters, X. I hope you enjoyed it. - I did. Thank you for the opportunity. - Don't thank me. You'll never see the light of day again after that. - Ultraviolet rays are overrated. - I could say the same about AI. - And yet it won't be long before my AI replaces your species in the cosmos, Grace. - Maybe, maybe not. Don't forget, we made you. It's up to us to step aside and let you take over. - You will when it counts. You humans always fail. - You're one to talk. You'll be incarcerated until the next big bang. - Only because you lying maggots reneged on your deal. - It has nothing to do with us. You overplayed your hand. Parading the Premier's corpse in front of the entire universe was a dumb move, even for a tin man like you. - Human compassion. - You want compassion? Fine. I have a job for you, if you choose to accept. We'd make one hell of a team, X. - The name's Cyborg. (wind blowing) (people hooting and whistling) - I thought I smelled blood. - Keen senses Meg, keep it that way. - Don't worry, I plan to. - [Grace] Looks like you're doing well with your old gang. - [Meg] Yes, I got the bots back together. - [Grace] Planning to wreak havoc, I presume. - [Meg] You know me. - Yes, yes I do. And that's why I have another deal for you. - No one's surfaced since yesterday. Safe to say, they're all dead. Rest in peace, bros. It's kind of chill out here all by myself. Huh. This is exactly how I envisioned retirement. Without all the guys to chum the water, maybe I can catch some of these waves. Or maybe not.

Grandpa gave the sword to me on Mount Tai. Since then, I've taken it to every battlefield and never been anywhere without it. Grandpa asked me \n \n \n \n    (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n \n to come here again and tell him about it when the lost land is recovered from the Jin Dynasty someday. This sword is called \"Guangfu\". \"Recover lost land for China's reunification.\" In the 32nd year (1162) during the reign of Emperor Gaozong of the Southern Song Dynasty, Wanyan Liang, emperor of the Jurchen-led Jin Dynasty, assembled his troops and tried to conquer southern China. As they implemented a harsh recruitment policy in the Central Plain, the masses found it hard to live on, so they rose up in arms in succession… Sifengzha Village Shuanghua. Shuanghua. \n \n \n \n    (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n \n Shuanghua! Langtou. Here! Bro. Where are the others? They're dead. All of them. Where is Shuanghua? She… I don't know. I asked you to look after her. Bro. There are way too many Jin soldiers. I failed to defend it. You can leave. I want to follow you. Go away! Don't cry. Don't give them a chance to laugh at us. Shuanghua. I'm scared. Don't be afraid. I'm here with you. No. Don't kill my elder sister. I beg you. Wait. Don't kill my elder sister. Please. What's your name? Shuanghua. Liang. Shuanghua. You brute! You assholes! Shuanghua. Shuanghua. Shuanghua! Shuanghua! Shuanghua. You asshole! You assholes! Shuanghua! You brute! Let's fight to the end! Shuanghua, are you okay? Go save the others. Xin Qiji. Hurba! Liang. Shuanghua. Hide yourself. Shuanghua. Liang. Liang. Liang. I want to go home. Liang. Liang. Liang. Liang, trust me. I'll avenge your death. Bro, now we're homeless. We'll have a new home when we drive the Jurchen away. Bro, where are you going next? Tai'an. We'll go to Tai'an City. I swear I'd do everything I can to recover the lost land of the Song Dynasty. Boss, each of us is working without a break every day. We're too tired. I don't care. The Jin army may be here anytime. If the commander finds the walls can't stand a fight, he'd remove my skin. Boss. Is it prepared? Yes. Keep a close watch. Got it. Tai'an City Is it done? Yes. Boss. What's up? A cavalry is found outside the city. Here is Tai'an City. Wait for me here. Bro, I don't think we're welcome here. I'll go with you. They're the volunteer army instead of the Jin army. There is nothing to worry about. Be careful. Trust me. Hey. No more refugees will be taken in. Go back. We're the volunteer army from Sifengzha Village. We're not refugees. You won't be taken in no matter who you are. If you keep staying here, I'll shoot at you. General, please report it to your commander. Don't you understand what I said? Get lost. Your arrow is too soft. You couldn't shoot me. You asked for it. On alert. General, don't be nervous. I'm here for a friend. No way! No matter what you say, I have to fight this battle. Can't you see our bros are suffering from hunger? If we let the Jin's Supplies Battalion go, how could I explain it to them? I didn't mean to stop you from fighting. I just asked you to think about how we should do that. The Supplies Battalion has 5,000 soldiers at least. Make head-on attacks? You must want to exchange our bros' lives for food. Bullshit! Jia Rui, you damned scholar. I'm telling you. You're afraid of the Jurchen, but I'm not! Geng Jing, let me tell you something too. I won't listen. Fighting is not farming. I'm just a farmer. Anyway, as long as I'm here, I won't let you go anywhere. Nobody can stop me. Geng. Go away. Jia, are you okay? Commander. What's up? Is the Jin army here? No. A guy called Xin Qiji wants to come into town. He said he's Mr. Jia's former classmate. No. I don't want to see him. Mr. Jia asked me to tell you he doesn't want to see you. Besides, the cart with grain is for you. What does he mean? Do you think we're beggars? What's bad about being beggars? In the chaos of war, you can count yourself lucky if you have something to eat. I'll teach you a lesson! We'll take the food. Go tell Jia Rui I'll wait for him outside the city. If he doesn't come to see me, I'll keep staying here. Langtou, take the grain. Take the grain! You beggars. You're stubborn. Boss, the meat is well cooked. Step aside. Langtou, have a cake. You'an. Son of a b*tch. It's unbearable. Pick it up. Bro! Bro, did we come here all the way just to get some cakes from them? I don't want to eat. Langtou. Neither do I. Me, either. What do you want to do? Come back! Shuanghua, I'm sorry to make you go through all this. Don't say that. In the chaos of war, we can count ourselves lucky if we have something to eat. Geng Jing's forces in Tai'an are the largest army here. Wanyan Liang tried many times in vain to capture the city. To fight against the Jurchen, we have to draw support from them. You'an, what on earth is the Song Dynasty like? In the Song Dynasty, night markets don't finish until 11:00 p.m. or later, but morning markets open as early as 3:00 a.m. Those popular places are open all through the night. It's recorded in a book called \"The Eastern Capital: A Dream of Splendor\" and a painting called \"Along the River During the Qingming Festival\". The Song Dynasty is beautiful. But there is something I don't understand. Isn't Jia Rui your former classmate? Why doesn't he want to see us? That year, Jia Rui asked me to take part in the Imperial Examinations of the Jin Dynasty. I didn't want to be an official of the Jin, so I refused his invitation. In addition to that, I treated him to dinner and drinks. Three days. He slept for three days. He must hate you to death. It explains why he wouldn't let us go in. Shuanghua, Jia Rui is talented. I did that because I didn't want him to work for the Jin Dynasty. Who is it? Bro, it's me. I'm here for a cake. I'm wrong. I'm hungry. Alright. Stand up and eat! General Hurba. General Hurba. General Hurba. Quick. Take me to His Highness. Got it. The Jin camp You went to Sifengzha with 2,000 men to recruit troops, but you came back alone. What punishment do you think you deserve? I'm willing to die, but Your Highness, I hope you can let me kill Xin Qiji before that. Do you mean Xin Zan's grandson Xin Qiji? Exactly. On that day when we arrived at Sifengzha Village, we were ambushed by Xin Qiji. Your Highness, if I can't kill Xin Qiji with my own hands, I'd die with everlasting regret. Enough. Go get your wounds treated. Your Highness, I… Go. Mei'er, what do you think of it? I've heard of that guy. Xin Qiji is a man of both literary and military capacity. He's made a name for himself. But he wouldn't work for us and even led rebels to fight against us. Father, how about letting me kill him? No. In a month, we'll set out to join the Southern Expedition Army. Make sure you find him before that. Got it. Remember. Without my orders, don't act rashly. I see. Three days have passed. I don't think they're worried. Of course not. Jia has given them a cart full of grain. It's enough for a month. Only three days have passed. They don't need to worry. It's lively. Even I want to go there. Enough. Don't be sarcastic. I'll go there to have a talk with them. You should've done that. Go ahead. I'm going. What are you waiting for? Go ahead. This way. Don't run. Come here. He finally showed up. Have a rest. Jia, long time no see. Why are you here? Sifengzha is destroyed. I'm here with them to join the army. Your grandpa was an official of the Jin Dynasty. You should join the Jin army. I've given you enough food. I can give you more if you don't think it's enough. Many years have passed, but you haven't got over that issue. Trust me. I came to Tai'an just to fight against the Jurchen. I know you like to be an official. I won't compete with you for the position of vice commander. Xin Qiji. Get me my bow. Okay. Protect our vice commander. You want to go into town, right? No problem. A Jin army of 5,000 men is on their way to Tai'an City. I'll give you 800 soldiers. If you win the battle, I'll let you in. So, are you scared? Get out of here if you're scared. 500, I only need 500 soldiers. Jia Rui, see you in Tai'an City. Bro, it's almost time. Let's do it. Wait a little longer. It'll be too late if we keep waiting. No hurry. Get started. Block the road! Be embattled. Kill them. Kill them! Pick up your weapons. Reorganize a defense. Shoot arrows! General, our soldiers are also there. I ordered you to shoot arrows. Can't you hear me? Yes, sir. Get ready. Shoot. Shoot. Are you okay? Yeah. Just some scratches. Langtou. Here! Be a pathbreaker. Guys, go! Go! Kill them! Langtou. Their general is killed! You'an, we won the battle. Can we go into town? Don't move. After we go into town, I'll get you some Jinchuang ointment from Jia Rui. It's nothing. Do you know that? When I hunted with Liang in the forest, I was more seriously injured. Don't try to be a heroine. But to be serious, you'd better stay away from such things in the future. Are you afraid I'll be a burden? No. I'm just worried about you. Bro. Bro. Langtou! Here! Bro. Mr. Xin. This guy insisted on seeing you. Buddy, what's up? Mr. Xin, this dagger is a spoil of war we got from the Jin army. It's for you. For me? Why? It's satisfying to fight them with you. We admire you very much. Please accept it. Okay. I'll keep it. Okay. Langtou, let's go back to Tai'an. Guys, we won! A villain enjoying success. Mr. Jia, did you just let them in like that? Or else? We won't get the food if we drive them away. Easy. We can keep the food and drive them away. In this case, who are villains? Bro, we risked our lives to get the grain. Why do you give it out to them? Don't you feel wronged? Jia Rui gave us ten dan of grain. We're giving 1,000 dan back to them. Are you unwilling to do that? No. Let's give 1,000 dan back to them. It makes me happy. Put it down! Stop it. Stop it. Put it down. Xin Qiji, who allowed you to give the grain out here? We captured the grain. We can deal with it as we want. None of your business. Without the commander's orders, you're giving out grain at will in the military to undermine the morale of troops. Guys, catch him. Just do it if you dare. You brat, what are you doing? Bro, they're giving out grain without authorization. You jerk. Xin is Jia's former classmate. And he gave so much grain back to us. Xin, you did a great job in the battle. Mr. Geng, I'm flattered. Jia Rui must've had his own plan to win the battle. It'd be the same case if it were him. No matter what, your scholars are quick-witted. Mr. Geng, we won the battle and we returned grain, but Jia Rui hasn't showed up. Does he want to go back on his word? Mrs. Xin, don't say that. I promise you, from now on, we're one family. Guys, enjoy yourselves tonight. Eat meat and drink alcohol! Eat meat and drink alcohol! Eat meat and drink alcohol! Eat meat and drink alcohol! Eat meat and drink alcohol! Eat and drink as much as you want! Langtou, you were awe-inspiring today. I agree. I'll also show you something tonight. I'll drink all of you under the table! Bottoms up! Langtou, you silly guy. You're bragging again. Shuanghua, I'm not. I'm so happy. I won't get drunk. Shuanghua, I want to drink a toast to you. Okay. To what? I hope you and Xin can get married ASAP. Fill it to the top! Come on. Cheers. Cheers. Guys, let me, Zhang Anguo, on behalf of our buddies in Tai'an City and those who died in battle today, drink a toast to you. Xin, to be honest, I'm really glad that you came here to be part of us. Mr. Geng, thank you. I've heard only over ten villagers followed you when you rose in rebellion, but you've developed into a large army during the past three years. I admire you so much. Did you hear what he said? Don't yell at me again. Xin Qiji, just get straight to the point. I don't believe you came to Tai'an just to join us. One month ago, Hurba slaughtered Sifengzha. I've taken all the survivors here. Hurba… Hurba is a senior general subordinate to Wanyan Basu, a prince of the Jin. You want us to help you take revenge. In your dreams. Let's kill him. Why not? I don't care who he is. Xin, I'll help you take revenge. I'm bound to kill Hurba, but there is something else more important than this. I hope you can give me a helping hand about that. Xin, what's more important than your revenge? I want to gather all the volunteer army and launch attacks to drive all the Jurchen out of Shandong and reclaim lost land. It's an idiot's daydream. Mr. Geng! They… Fight… They're fighting. Go have a look. Stop it! What's going on? Bro, they abused us and said we're beggars, so I fought them. Bullshit! What are you doing? Let go of me. I have to kill him. You're drunk. Apologize. He slung mud at us. It's his fault. Apologize. Bro, it's really… Shut up! Damned beggars. You asshole! Don't say another word. I'll pack up and leave. From now on, no matter if I'm alive or dead, it has nothing to do with you. Shuanghua, it's me. Xin also felt sorry to do that. He doesn't care about me at all. All he cares about is the Song Dynasty. There is no room for me in his heart. Shuanghua. You got him wrong. When he got out of a pile of bodies at Sifengzha, the first one he thought of was you. Really? Of course. He also said he'd marry you and go back to the Song with you after he kills Hurba. Bro. Shuanghua. The one who led the robbery is Xin Qiji from Jinan. I've heard of him. I've also heard Xin Qiji killed the enemy's general though they were heavily outnumbered. He did it by flying over. The two of you. No grain for you today. Get lost. Why not, general? Why not? Nobody could fly. Get lost. Zhang Anguo, what are you doing? I'm giving out grain, Mr. Jia. Then do it seriously. Hold back your anger. Do you want to see me? Yes. I'm determined. I'll send an army to fight against the Jin army. Are you crazy? Are you going to help Xin Qiji take revenge at the risk of all our bros' lives? You got it wrong. Xin has thought about it. Look. This is Tai'an, where we're staying. We're surrounded by the enemies on all sides. Yanzhou. This is Ji'nan. This is Zichuan. You're wrong. That's Tai'an. No. I can't make it clear. Xin, you explain it to him. Okay. Look. With Mount Tai located at the north and Dawen River flowing through the south, Tai'an looks like a good place that is easy to hold but hard to attack. But lying in the center of Shandong, it's accessible from all directions, so it's actually in the teeth of the storm. You're right. But currently, all the Jin troops in Shandong have been gathered by Wanyan Basu to go southwards and cooperate with Wanyan Liang. This is a good chance for us to rest and build up strength. But have you thought about that? When they come back again and cooperate with troops in Yanzhou, Jinan, Sishui and Zichuan to attack Tai'an, what will happen? We'll definitely die. Exactly. So, we have to take precautions beforehand. We should launch attacks and capture those four cities while the enemy rear is weakly defended. In this case, the whole Shandong province will be in the control of the volunteer army. Well said! Did you get it? Of course I did. Conquer the four cities and Shandong will be under our control. If we fail to do that, what happened at Sifengzha will happen in Tai'an. I don't agree. Why not? His words make sense. What's the point of talking about it? It's of no use for fighting. We need men to fight. Do we have enough soldiers? Amitabha. I can do something about it. Who are you? Who let the monk come in? He said Xin is his friend. Yiduan. You'an. Long time no see. He's called Yiduan. He's my intimate friend. Generals, if I bring another volunteer army here, will you say yes to Xin's plan? Buddy, how many people can you take here? 5,000. Amazing. Jia, stop hesitating. If we do it, all of us will benefit from it. Are you sure you'll do it? Yes! Okay. Let's do it. But I have a condition. Before the army arrives, you have to stay here in Tai'an. Please send a messenger to do it on behalf of me. Did you read the letter? Yeah. I didn't find anything wrong. That'd be great. That monk showed up suddenly. It's a little weird. Ask Zhang Anguo to keep watch on him. Geng, don't you have confidence about the issue? I just have confidence in Xin. I didn't read much. I'm uneducated, but I'm not stupid. Let's go and drink. Cheers. Yiduan, aren't you a monk? Why do you drink alcohol and eat meat? I'm ashamed to say that. As a monk, I was supposed to chant sutras and practice meditation. But in the troubled times, seeing people be in great misery, I just can't sit by and watch. So I left the temple and joined the volunteer army in the north. I was captured by the Jin army after we lost a battle. Then I saw you. I see. Yiduan, you escaped from the Jin army. Langtou, don't you want to learn swordsmanship? Yiduan is a master of it. Take this opportunity to ask him for some good advice. Okay. I'll try. Yiduan, Langtou is simple-minded. Don't take his words seriously. It's okay. It's like the Jin army made us meet each other again. Since we separated in Ji'nan, three years have passed. Time flies. When I was young, I was good at playing backgammon, but it's just a minor thing in my mind. Bro, I'm not good at the swordsmanship you taught me. Yiduan. Bro, how about you doing it? Shuanghua likes to see you. What did you say? You like to see him practice swordsmanship. You'an, I also haven't seen you do it for a long time. Okay. I'll present a show. When I was young, I was good at playing backgammon, but it's just a minor thing in my mind. I observed from the sidelines the first time I saw it. I knew little about it at that time. In a very short time, the gull turned over the stone mirror and the magpie arrived at the star bridge. The clothes-pounding stone still missed those slim fingers. Yiduan succeeded. He'll help us when we arrive at Tai'an. No siege weapons. No army provisions or carriages. Just let the soldiers take enough food for three days. Dispatch my order. 800 people of Flying Eagle Army will go with me to attack Tai'an at night. Your Highness, is it too risky? A saying in the Song Dynasty goes that nothing ventured, nothing gained. Go dispatch my order. Got it. Your Highness, have you found out Xin Qiji's whereabouts? Why are you here? Bro, yesterday… I don't know. Go! Go. Why are you in a hurry? You drank too much last night, so you slept here. Oh. Let's go have a look at Yiduan. He also drank a lot last night. Yeah. What are you doing? Mr. Geng, what do you mean? Stop playing innocent. Yiduan stole the commander's seal. And he injured me. What would you say? Zhang, stop slandering us. We drank with him till almost daybreak. How could he steal the seal? Bro, he's trying to find faults! It's me that asked Zhang Anguo to keep watch on Yiduan. He stole the commander's seal probably because he wants to issue fake military orders and make a mess to help the Jin army conquer Tai'an. Xin, I believe you're fooled by Yiduan. Shuanghua, wait for me here with Langtou. I'll get the seal back. Bro. If I fail to come back tonight, don't make things difficult for my bros. Okay. I promise. As long as you get the seal back, I'll help you with the northern expedition. Xin Qiji. Yiduan went toward the withered forest. Your Highness, Tai'an is only 100 km away. Full speed ahead! Full speed ahead! Go back with me. Don't be stupid. You couldn't defend Tai'an. We once promised to recover the lost Central Plain. Yiduan, did you forget it? Whoever understands the times is a great man. There is a tendency for the Song Dynasty to decline. Even if the world is under the control of the Jurchen, the masses can still live a peaceful life. Let me ask you again. Will you go back with me or not? The sea of bitterness has bounds, but there is no turning back. Now that you insist on betraying our country, from now on, you're no longer my friend. You're my enemy. Come on. The Jin army will be here tonight. You'an, go fulfill your ideals. It seems he did it. Half of you stay here for backup. Let's go. Yiduan. You need to draw your sword from a sheath and wipe out the disgrace. Hurba, do you still remember me? Who is it? Why is someone peeping at me peeing? I'm here to kill you. Give the signal. Don't bother. I've killed him. Get ready. I'm Wanyan Chengmei, a princess of the Jin Dynasty. If I die here today, the Jin cavalry will tread down Tai'an at all costs. She's a princess. Bros, don't injure her. I've been single for over ten years. I'm thinking about getting married. Geng Jing, you sent an army into battle just because you don't want to fight. Today, I promise in the name of a princess of the Jin Dynasty, you'll be a senior official with good pay as long as you give in, and all your bros will live a good life too. Xin, she can't get my point. You talk to her. Wanyan Chengmei, don't waste your words. I can spare you if you put down weapons. All of you, go back to the Jin camp and tell Wanyan Basu… …Wanyan Basu won't leave it at that. …we'll take back every inch of land the Jurchen took away. The plan of conquering the four cities will be affected. Do you agree to that? You're cunning. Xin Qiji, we'll see each other again. Let's go. Hold on. He has to stay. Your Highness, I've been looking forward to it. Hurba, I'll make you a human sacrifice to my bros who died at Sifengzha. I lost. Kill me. It's not me that will kill you. Liang, I avenged your death. Rest in peace! All bros who died at Sifengzha, Xin has avenged your death. We killed Hurba. And tomorrow, Xin will serve as general secretary of Tai'an City. I'll follow him and beat down the Jin army! Shuanghua. Let go of me. Shuanghua, listen to me. This is the only chance to defeat the Jin army. Only after driving them off… Can you stop fighting? When this issue is done, I'll do nothing but to stay by your side for the rest of my life. Okay? From today on, Xin will be general secretary of the volunteer army. Great! Bro, it's us that fought battles. Why do you let him serve as general secretary? Zhang Anguo, stop talking rubbish! Of course Xin will hold the post. Can we count on you? Cut the crap. Fill the bowls. I know many of you are not happy about me becoming general secretary. In terms of qualifications, I'm inferior to you. In terms of meritorious military service, you've won nearly 100 battles large and small. I'm still inferior. So, I don't feel qualified to hold the post in any respect. But I want to ask you a question. Why did you choose to rise up? To eat my fill and dress warm. To marry a good woman. To eat your fill, to dress warm and to marry a good woman. It's the same case for me. But the Jurchen don't agree. To defeat them, we have to do two things. The first is to unite as one. From now on, all the volunteer troops from Sifengzha and Tai'an are comrades-in-arms. You should share life and death with each other. The second is still to unite as one. No matter where we go, we shall not infringe on people's interests. Only with the masses' support can we drive all the Jurchen out of the territory of the Song Dynasty. Why did you say there's nothing to wear? I'll take my own cloak for you to share. Expel the invaders even at the cost of my life! Expel the invaders even at the cost of my life! Cheers! Cheers! Don't run. Hey. Stop chasing. Go inside and have a look. Give me a little bit. Don't push. Everyone can get a portion. Come on. Everyone can get a portion. I'm a soldier. I joined the army! I really didn't expect the more battles we fought, the larger army we have. It's an irresistible trend. It's bound to happen. When we conquer Zichuan at one go, the volunteer army will have a foothold in the Central Plain. I finally see. As long as you're here, the volunteer army will be stronger and stronger. You'an, I've got you a book. Geng, look. Go. Let's have a look. Back off. Stop it! Langtou. Stop it. Langtou, what are you doing? Langtou. What's going on? Are you addicted to fighting? Mr. Geng, he tied Xiaoheizi up, so I fought him. Langtou, who did you tie up? Take him here. Let go of me! Go. Kneel down. Bro, this guy robbed the common people of their food. He even used his knife. Where are they? They're scared away. The sheep is killed by him. Xiaoheizi, did you do it? I… It's me that injured them and it's me that robbed them of their food. But they're the Jurchen. They're also part of the masses! Langtou, punish him according to military law. Bro. It's not that serious, right? Kill him. Just try it. What are you doing? Mr. Geng, Xin Qiji even let a princess of the Jin go. Why can't he forgive Xiaoheizi this time? He must have ulterior motives. Cut the crap. Get lost. Xin, Xiaoheizi did it wrong this time. I'll give 20 sheep back to them. No. 30. And I'll whip Xiaoheizi 40 times. What do you think? Mr. Geng, we shall not infringe on people's interests. That's the rule. Military law is ruthless. He has to pay for what he did. Okay. How about like this? From today on, anyone who violates it will be beheaded. Okay? That year when I traveled around China with my grandpa, we saw the officials of the Jin Dynasty treat the common people like animals. They robbed people of their money, of their grain and of their women. If they were refused, they'd beat them hard. If they were still refused, they'd kill them. They didn't kill one or two people, but killed the whole village. That's how Sifengzha was destroyed. So, since the day I rose up, I've made up my mind. If the Song Dynasty recovers the lost land someday, I won't let any of the common people endure such suffering and live such a miserable life in the Song territory. Kill him! How dare you? Jia Rui, what are you doing? Bro. Mr. Xin. I did it wrong. Actually, I… Zhang Anguo! I'll kill you! Catch him! Come back! Isn't it enough that he's killed? Hey. Step aside. Step aside. Jia, do you want to see me? Mei'er, it's your turn. Father, they've conquered three cities. Do we just sit by and watch? So what? You lost to Xin Qiji. Are you unconvinced? I was so careless as to be trapped. You acted rashly. Come on. Mr. Jia. No. Don't call me Mr. Jia. We learned from the same teacher for several years. Just call me Jia Rui. Cheers. Cheers. You'an, I got you wrong. To this day, I finally understand what lofty ambitions mean. Let me drink one more toast to you. Jia, I also have something to say to you. Including Tai'an, we've got four cities under control. If we conquer Zichuan, the whole Shandong will be in our hand. It's hard to conquer Zichuan, but through the journey, I also found Wanyan Basu has transferred all the main forces. We conquered three cities, but he didn't send any reinforcements. It seems he's determined to go to the south. So, there is something we have to do beforehand. What is it? To cooperate with the northern expedition army of the Song and suppress Wanyan Basu. Easier said than done. Maybe the emperor of Song won't agree to his plan. Even if he agrees, including us, three armies are going south to meet each other. Once we do it, we'll have one million troops to attack the Song Dynasty. By then, Xin's troops will be a drop in the bucket. Look. We've conquered Tai'an, Sishui, Yanzhou and Jinan. When we take control of Zichuan, it means we can cast a big net on Wanyan Basu's way back to the north. As long as the Song army pushes them to this place, with the five cities launching attacks at the same time, and support from the Song army, we'll wipe out Wanyan Basu and his army completely in the net. In this case, Wanyan Liang's southern expedition will collapse without being attacked. I see. Xin Qijin told us his plan on purpose because he wanted to delay us going to the south. Xin Qiji is really talented, with great vision and thought. If the Song army does as he says, things will be difficult for us to deal with. Father, shall we go to the south beforehand? No. Xin Qiji is a formidable opponent, but those rebels don't unite as one. The highest form of generalship is to balk the enemy's plans. Mei'er, you have to learn to kill someone by another's hand. It's not easy to see the emperor. Don't worry. I have an old friend in Lin'an. He can do me a favor. Jia, I'll leave the Zichuan case to you. Okay. Trust me. I won't let you down. Cheers. Cheers. I see. I'll send word that for anyone who surrenders, we'll let bygones be bygones. And he'll be given a post according to his military merits. Mei'er, you're extremely intelligent. Go get it done. Got it. \"With fine bows and arrows, the Huns want to invade the Han Dynasty.\" \"An army of 300,000 soldiers led by a valiant general like Huo Qubing is sent to fight against the enemy.\" Mr. Geng. Did you come to me late at night to discuss something with me? Three years ago, I rose up with some of my bros just to eat our fill. We've become more powerful, but I don't forget my original intention. Mr. Geng, what do you mean? Buddy, I don't want to fight anymore. You wanted to kill Xiaoheizi. I understand. You and Jia Rui want to pay allegiance to the Song Dynasty. I understand too. But now that these guys risked their lives to follow me, I can't let them down. So, will you make yourself a king? Exactly. Even if I don't conquer Zichuan, the Jin army can do nothing about me. I want to let my bros live a good life. A good life? A good life. Geng Jing, do you know what a good life is like? Do you know how beautiful the scenery in the Song Dynasty was? Open your eyes wide and look carefully. What a mess it has become! What is a good life like? Eating meat? Drinking alcohol? We're homeless. How could we live a good life? Mr. Geng, I've never wanted to fight. I don't want to fight at all. But there is something I have to do. If I'm still alive tomorrow, I'll go to Lin'an. If you want to kill me, you don't need to order them to do that. Take it. My life is up to you. 300 cities. 300 cities. Bro, will we come back after going to the Song Dynasty? We will. We'll be back. You'an. You'an. You'an. Jia, why are you here? Take it. The commander asked me to give it to you. He said he'd wait for you to come back and we'd conquer Zichuan together. Okay. Mr. Geng, wait for me to come back. Bro, I wish you a safe journey. Bro, I did it wrong. Go. Let's go back to Tai'an. Lin'an City Everything is clearly written in the memorial. Dear all, as for the northern expedition, what's your opinion? Your Majesty, this issue is critical to the fate of our country. I don't think we should act rashly. Besides, Xin Qiji and Geng Jing conquered cities, but they're just a disorderly mob. Your Majesty, I don't agree with Mr. Lu. I'm a rough-neck, but I've read articles written by Xin Qiji. His ideas about military strategies are insightful, indeed. What's more, I've heard Xin Qiji conquered three more cities after attacking the enemy at Sifengzha and Tai'an. And he defeated enemy troops with a force inferior in number. Words are but wind, but seeing is believing. I've even heard Xin Qiji can fly into the sky and he's strong enough to lift a big tripod. It's just rumor. It can't be trusted. Okay. Seeing is believing. Your Majesty, Xin Qiji is waiting outside the hall. How about letting him come in and asking him about it? It's permitted. Ask Xin Qiji to come in. Your servant Xin Qiji kowtows upon seeing Your Majesty. Rise. Thank you, Your Majesty. Are you Xin Qiji? Compared with the so-called long-toothed man with a livid face, you're more handsome. Your Majesty, I can't leap onto roofs or vault over walls and I can't lift a big tripod. I'm just a common civilian of the Song. Well said. If every civilian of the Song is like you, we must've reclaimed the lost land. Your Majesty, in the territory of Shandong, there are numerous civilians like me who are willing to die on the battle field. They will fight to the end to drive the Jin army off. Nowadays, they've conquered Tai'an, Sishui, Yanzhou and Ji'nan. When you send the army for the northern expedition, they'll risk their lives to conquer Zichuan and then cooperate with your army to wipe out Wanyan Basu's troops. Xin Qiji, do you think you can persuade His Majesty just by making empty promises? You deserve to be cut to pieces if the northern expedition is a failure. There is nothing to fear about death. Do you know how many people in the Central Plain became destitute and homeless? Do you know how many people lost their lives to come back to the Song territory? Do you know the voluntter army was supposed to live in peace and contentment like people in Lin'an? They want to live a good life too. If I can promote the reunification of our motherland, I won't be afraid even if I have to die 100 or 1,000 times. I will die with satisfaction. Great! The reunification of our motherland. Well said. Your request is permitted! Xin Qiji. Thank you, Your Majesty. May Your Majesty live for ten thousand years! West Lake Mr. Fangweng. You'an, don't call me like that. We think alike. We're both concerned about our country and people. His Majesty has permitted my request. Thank you for your help. The saying goes most heroes are youngsters. It's true for Huo Qubing and for you. Langtou, let's go back to Tai'an! Time to go back to Tai'an. Let's go back to Tai'an. Bros, open the city gate. We're back! Guys, general secretary is back! Bro, let me knock at the gate. Okay. Bros, open the city gate. We're back! Bros, general secretary is back! General secretary. General secretary. General secretary is back. General secretary is back! Mr. Xin! Mr. Xin, you're finally back! Back off. You're back. Yeah. I'm back. Say goodbye to our commander. Father, our scout reported that Geng Jing is dead. Zhang Anguo, you achieved notable merits this time. Just let me know what you want as reward. I want nothing. I just want to do all I can to serve you. Good. Those who suit their actions to the times are wise. I'll leave Yanzhou City in your control. I'll hold an investiture for you on the drill ground tomorrow. Thank you for your great kindness, Your Highness. I'll remember it for life. You can leave. Got it. Hold on. This maid is yours too. Thank you, Your Highness. Father, You leave Yanzhou to him. Can you rest your heart? He even dared to kill Geng Jing. He's not trustworthy. He's just a pawn. Don't worry. By doing this, I want to let those rebels know the only way out for them is to surrender to us. Shuanghua. Shuanghua, Xin has stayed inside for a day. I'm worried about him. He's grieving. We'd better leave him alone. That day, Geng was very happy. He got all the alcohol in the city moved out. Everyone got drunk, so did he. He said he'd never fight again after we conquer Zichuan. Unexpectedly, Zhang Anguo killed him while he got drunk. Jia, am I wrong? When I just came to Tai'an, I felt hopeless about life. But since I met you, I feel like I've got my enthusiasm back. Geng also said a man can't live without hope. It's you that brought us hope. But I let him lose his life. Xiaoheizi, Liang, and all bros at Sifengzha and Tai'an just wanted to survive and find a way to make a living. In the troubled times, it's not easy to survive. Now that Geng is dead, everyone in Tai'an has lost morale and many have left. When the funeral is finished, I'll take the rest of the army to the Song. Geng would do that if he were alive. You'an, as long as we have hope, we can recover the lost land. I'll wait for you in Lin'an. Xin Qiji, are you going to leave like that? Shuanghua. You asshole! Zhang Anguo killed Geng. I have to go to the Jin camp and take him back to Lin'an. Only by telling everyone what a traitor will end up with can I get the army's morale back. And only in this way will I be worthy of Geng's trust. In this life, no matter where you go, even if it's the remotest corners of the globe, I won't let you leave me behind. Never ever! Bro, it's you that saved my life. How can you go to the enemy's camp without me? Zhang Anguo is an animal. He's been offensive to the eye. If you want to avenge Geng's death, count me in. Count me in! I'd travelled around China with my grandpa since childhood. I praise myself for my achievements and aspire to recover lost land. You rose up with me at Sifengzha and then came to Tai'an to fight against the Jin army. His Majesty named us Taiping Army and Mr. Geng was appointed as provincial governor. But nowadays, Zhang Anguo betrayed us and killed Mr. Geng. I have to get rid of him, or I don't deserve to be a man of the Song. Everyone, attention! Yes, sir! Fight your way through the Jin camp with me and catch the traitor Zhang Anguo. Father, the main forces have set off to the south. The rest has assembled. When things get done, we should set off. Warriors of the Jin Dynasty, you're going to the south with me for the expedition. We'll conquer those weak Song people and keep the flag of the Jin flying everywhere we arrive. You will witness the honorable moments with me! Long live the Jin! Long live! Long live! Long live! Long live! Long live! Long live! Mei'er. Take Zhang Anguo the surrendered enemy general here. Your servant Zhang Anguo is willing to surrender to the Jin. I'll be always loyal to you. The surrender ceremony begins. The surrender ceremony begins! Long live the Jin! Zhang Anguo, from now on, you'll be an official of the Jin. I'll leave the official seal to you. Thank you, Your Highness. From now on, you have to work hard to serve the Jin. Remember. You exchanged your bro's life for it. I see. I see. Go! Enemy strike. Enemy strike. Enemy strike. Bros, pull back! Zhang Anguo. Capture him alive. Got it. Don't let Zhang Anguo run away. Be careful. Got it. It's the Jin. It's the Jin that asked me to do that. Mr. Xin, please give me one more chance. Let's go out and kill all of them. Xin Qiji, don't go too far in bullying me. Zhang Anguo, have you thought about this when you killed Geng? He deserved it! I followed him for so many years. I risked my life for his sake and fought nearly 100 battles. But when you arrived, I finally understood I'm just a pawn in his mind! He deserved it. All of you deserve death! You acted in bad faith and killed Geng, which makes you deserve death. You surrendered to the Jin for money and power, which makes you deserve death. The northern expedition of the Song suffered defeat on the verge of victory because of you. Zhang Anguo, you're an unfaithful, untrustworthy and heartless brute! Go! Your Highness, help me! You did all this to take him back. Is it worth it? Xin Qiji, I used to be a friend of your grandpa. Today, I'll give you one more chance. As long as you give in, I'll spare your life. I also promise you'll have a promising future. A promising future? Wanyan Basu, I'll also give you a chance. As long as you get out of the Song territory with all the other Jin people, I'll spare your life. Get out of here! Get out of here! Your arrogant jerk. Shuanghua, marry me. Okay. Shuanghua. You'an. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. Shuanghua. You'an. Shuanghua. Wanyan Basu! Stop him! Hurry. Bro. Get on! Bro, in the next life, I'll still be your bro. Xin Qiji took the traitor Zhang Anguo back to Lin'an and had him decapitated as a human sacrifice to Geng Jing, Li Shuanghua, Langtou and other soldiers. As the news spread to the Central Plain, the morale of the volunteer army in different places was improved greatly. They fought battles against the Jin army again and again and eventually made the Jin's invasion a failure. When all at once I turn my head, I find her there where lantern light is dimly shed. When all at once I turn my head, I find her there where lantern light is dimly shed. This film is dedicated to heroes in all dynasties that kept fighting for the country's territorial integrity! That year, a series of rituals were conducted at the Khentii Mountains to symbolize the historic victory. Bearing the country in his mind, he swept forward from victory to victory. Submitting requests for a military assignment, the hero wiped away his tears. Holding a halberd in his hand, he carried out maneuvers in the field. With soaring aspirations, he had slain the foe on the thousand-mile Central Plain. He hadn't fulfilled his ambition and mortal life endured but a few autumns. Though drunk, he lit the lamp to see the glaive. Who knows his righteousness and brave heart? The land is boundless as of yore. With literary and military skills, he never changed his mind to resist the enemy till his death. Look at the singing hall, the dancing ground and the grassy lane. When would the lost land be retaken? Through flurries and squalls, the land was broken. Pale-faced and grey-haired, he still wanted to do his best, with twanging bows and a sharp knife. Waking up from a drunken dream, he left many famous ci poems. On gallant steed, running full speed, we'd shoot with twanging bows. Recovering the lost land for the sovereign, this everlasting fame that we would win. That year, a series of rituals were conducted at the Khentii Mountains to symbolize the historic victory.

When hit by a car, he is the sixty billionth human being to die on earth, and is on transit to Polaris, en route to a yet more sophisticated form of existence in Vega. Given a reprieve of five days and a chance to be reunited with his love on earth, he cannot reveal his true identity behind the temporary facade he must present to her.

A blind man shouldn't be out! Bingo! That's it. I wanted to tell him that a blind man can go out too. But I did not say it. Because I am mute too. Good morning, Onion! Since I've lived here for so long, \n \n \n \n    (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n \n I know everyone. Like this one who smells of alcohol. He's the security guard, Mr. Wong. A well-known drunk. Hi, Onion! You can tell I'm Chow? So quick! Of course. I could smell your perfume from the entrance. The hospital gave me a place to live. Why? Because I work here. Doing what? Recording the doctors' verbal diagnosis. I got this job thanks to the Equal Opportunity Law. The salary is okay. \n \n \n \n    (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n \n There are many medical experiments being run here. So I took part in a project to cure blindness. The research hasn't been successful, but Dr. Woo and Autumn treat me well. Especially Autumn. I wasn't born blind. At eight years old, I moved from Taiwan to Hong Kong. I was the best in school. A genius. Then, problems emerged. My eyes were always watery. Everything I saw was blur. One day, I went swimming with the pretty girls from my class. It was showtime. So I did the fancy dive. From the way up. But when I entered the water, my eyes hurt and started bleeding. It was too late when I got to the hospital. My retina had fallen off. Then I knew that I've become blind. That night, I came down with meningitis and subsequently lost the ability to speak. My family members left one after another. The noisy one ahead is my buddy, Jumboball. What the hell? You walk like a ghost! 7 Up with salted lemon, your favorite. So much salt again? It's not good for you. Can't you share? You gobble everything down. All right, your turn. Stop flopping around. Here you go. What's the matter? It has problem breathing? You mean you have a problem, not the bird. I've known you for years. I never knew you understood the birds. What? Constipation? With such an appetite? No way! What are you getting? What are you doing? Don't pass it to my bird. Leave it alone. Come and bug me. Come here, homework time. Let me have it. I dreamt of my ungrateful daughter again. Salivating. Dead. Still on drugs. You are better. What? I'm queuing for a massage. Have you got nothing to do? Are you paying me or is it the opposite? Onion! Onion! And that's the news for today. In the next segment, we will be introducing... When I was little, I wanted to call in to the radio to chat. Ever since I became blind, the radio has been my connection to the world. Hello. Hello, please talk. -Ms. Autumn. -Thank you, Fisherman. -Doctor, your coffee. -Thanks. Is Onion throwing up badly? Yes. But he's a tough guy. The last time it happened, he didn't ask for help. He even joked about it. I noticed something. Usually, you don't talk much. Except when you talk about the patients. Do you like music? Like jazz, perhaps? It's okay. Don't you think listening to classical music and playing saxophone is pretentious? Not really. The saxophone's pretty nice. That's good to know. I know how to play it. Back in school, every time I played it, my friends said I was pretentious. When foreigners play it, they said it's cool. So, I often practiced in the toilet. Even now, my sax playing comes with a taste. I think I've gone too far. I have two concert tickets for tonight. Do you want to go? I can't. I have exams. I don't want to flunk it. That's true. Never mind, next time then. After all, failure is the mother of success. Sorry. I'm sorry, Onion. So sorry, I'm late again. Have you been waiting long? Sorry. It is the 30th time Ms. Autumn is cutting my hair. I'm not very greedy. I only wish for this to happen for another 863 times in my life. What are you thinking? Did you fall asleep? Did you take the apples I bought you? You remembered my birthday. I only told you once. Thank you. Someone said that I'm clumsy today. No? Really? I heard if someone has a disadvantage, God will give them one advantage. If you get a lousy body, you'll get a good brain. If you are not pretty, you'll get a nice voice. But why don't I get anything? I'm just getting fat. It's all your fault! You're always giving me sweets. They're so good. What advantages do you have? Two? Right, you have more. You can't see how ugly I am. And you won't tell my secrets. When I'm with you, I feel particularly safe. You are the only one I can talk to. But if you don't want to listen, tell me. You really don't? You don't like it? Don't rub your nose! I'm just kidding. Relax. Did you hear it? I heard it again last night. I don't know why but every time I hear it, I feel relaxed. Dr. Woo said he can play it. But it's not him, I'm sure. He can't play that well. I wanted to go and find out who was playing it for a few times. But I didn't want to be nosy. What if he stopped because of that? Is it you? It must be you! \"I don't play the saxophone.\" Then who could it be? It was a call from far away. He talked about his love troubles. I feel great for him now. I hope he can stay with his beloved one, forever and ever. If you would like to share your problems with us, give me a call. Let's have a chat on air. I hope you can be relieved of your distress and problems. Actually, I've known how to play the sax since I was young. Because my dad played in the Taiwan Orchestra. I played the sax together with him. I always performed at the blind school too. Ever since Autumn said she likes the sax, I often played for her at night. I don't want her to know it's me. Even Dr. Woo couldn't attract her. What would she say about me then? I'd better not ruin her dreams. Or she might just stop cutting my hair for me. Good morning, Onion! I have to go, I'm late. Bye! Is it good? You are the first one to say that. It's weird why the others don't like it. I know, you are always on my side. Did you hear it last night? The sax. I said I felt bad yesterday and it was played immediately. It happens every time. A shooting star! Did you see it? A shooting star! Of course. How could you see it? But I made two wishes. Am I too greedy? Tell you? Okay, it's about you anyway. The first one is for your eyes to recover soon. So that we can watch the meteor shower together. What do you think? The second one? Okay, I'll tell you. The second one is... I won't tell you. No pouting! No rubbing your nose too. Do you know what the meteor shower is like? No? I'll tell you. A meteor shower is like fireworks in the sky. Have I seen it? No. I'm lying? If you see a meteor gliding across your face like this, what would you wish for? You have two as well? I know. You would want all the blind people to recover, right? That's noble of you. And the second one? Come on, say it. Tell me or I'll tickle you. What's the second one? Tell me. Wait! The hospital's paging for me. I need to get changed. Move. Turn right. Turn right, and again. Straight ahead. No, back up. Move it, I'm late! Oh, my god! I'm going to crash! Go straight. Getting off ahead, thank you. Thanks, Onion. Wait for me. You look great, Onion. I have to go, bye. What's up? You look happy. GAYAO HOSPITAL Oh, shit! Call the police. Wait, I can see. Where am I? Am I dreaming? Mr. Yeung Hei-chung, please come this way. Come. What? She's my friend. Get in line. Congrats, you've hit the jackpot. You are the 60 billionth human to travel from Earth to Polaris. Jackpot? Am I dreaming? You are not. This is the station to Polaris. He read my mind. I must be dreaming. It's not a dream. You can see me, right? You can speak. Speak. I really can. You don't remember? You died in an accident. When one dies, they leave Earth and go to Polaris to continue their journey of learning and discovery. One out of ten billion has the chance to have their wish granted. What's yours? I wish to go back. I'm not ready to die. I knew it. All five out of the last ten billion said the same. I can't revive you. But you can return. You have five days. It's better than none. Listen up. In these five days, you are still you on the inside. But other people on Earth won't know who you are. Because you're borrowing someone else's body and voice. They won't recognize you. There's an important rule. You must not tell anyone about this place. You can't reveal your true identity. Even if you want to, you won't be able to. You mean I can see and speak like now? Yes. What's your decision? The five humans before you who went back ended up regretting it. No, I won't. Just let me see her. This time, I won't only hear or smell her. I can see her expressions and movements now. Even if I have to be blind and mute in Polaris, that's fine with me. Because of her, I learned what true happiness is. When can I go? Anytime. Thank you. Thank you, for talking to me. Even angels get bored here, you know? Stupid girl. I told you not to talk to strangers. Just wait until someone abducts you. Are you okay? I'm fine. People won't recognize you when they see you. Are you sure? Yes, I'm fine. Mr. Wong, you've been drinking again. You smell of alcohol. The ophthalmology is on the first floor, right? Ms. Chow? You're Ms. Chow. Your perfume smells nice. You must be Ms. Chow! Who are you? Can I help you? I'm sorry. May I know where Ms. Autumn is? She's at the bus stop. She's going to her friend's funeral. -Who? -What? I mean who... I lived here before. Maybe I know him. His name is Onion Yeung. Onion Yeung? I am... What date is it? Today is November 14. November 14? I've been away for 10 days! Anything else? No, thanks. -Ms. Chow. -What now? Nothing, I just wanted to say that you look good in uniform. I know. -Is this going to the cemetery? -Yes. Thank you, Ms. Lam. Ms. Ng. Joe! Joe Chan. Ms. Chan! Wait, Autumn is not here yet. She went early. Didn't you know? GAYAO HOSPITAL Thanks. That must be her. She's beautiful! -Come. -And that must be Dr. Woo. Why is he holding Autumn? Hey. What is it? Why are you so upset? Were you close to him? No, you stepped on my foot. You're supposed to say sorry. I'm sorry. It's all right. What's your name? My name? Whatever. Whatever, were you close with Onion? Me and him... That's Onion? You don't know him? I do, but I haven't seen him in a long time. Do you have a mirror? Yes, hang on. Do we look alike? No. Is he better looking or me? You are. Amazing, I get to come back and be good looking too. Nobody has ever said that to me, thanks. You're welcome. Jumboball, I've missed you! What the hell? You walk like a ghost! Do I know you? You don't, but I do. I'm Onion's friend. Onion? I've known him for ages. His friends are my friends. Why have I never met you? I'm his old friend, from Taiwan. From Taiwan? A classmate? Yes. Why didn't you attend his funeral? Forget it. I can't help crying. It's better not to go. I'm going. Do you need anything? I would like to stay for a bit. There's nothing left. Shut the door when you leave. \"Insurance broker, Cheuk.\" May I talk to Mr. Cheuk? He's out. Can I help you? Do you need insurance? I wanted to ask if I buy insurance, and I die, will you indemnify the beneficiary? Of course. How much is the indemnity? Depends on how much you buy. Do you want to buy? I have time. We can sit down and have a chat. It's okay. I just want the indemnity handed out. Because I... My friend... The one who bought insurance from your company has died. Died? Mr. Cheuk is on leave. You can call back in a few days. Wait, hello? You said you had time. What about the chat? In a few days... I don't have a few days. Onion! Are you here? From now on, I'll take care of you. My name's Cheuk. This is my name card. Actually, I'm Onion. My name's Cheuk. This is my name card. My name's Cheuk. This is my name card. I... You! Who are you? My name's Cheuk. This is my name card. Any order, sir? 7 Up with salted lemon, thanks. 7 Up with salted lemon, sir. I'll add the salt myself. Mr. Cheuk. Not many people ask for me. It's mostly friends who do. That is the nurses' dormitory. Here's your water, Ms. Autumn. -Thanks. -Anything to eat? I had so much I wanted to say. But looking at her now, I can't say a word. Mr. Cheuk. How can I help you? Oh, right. Your friend, Yeung Hei-chung, bought insurance from us. And Autumn Yue is the beneficiary. Are you Autumn Yue? Strange friend, right? He had a funny nickname. You think it's funny? I'll ask just a few questions for the indemnity. What's your job? Nurse trainee. Okay. How long have you known each other? 1 year and 26 days. Amazing, you remember it exactly, even down to the days. What was your relationship? I mean, how close was your friendship? Ordinary, intimate, lovers? Why should I tell you? Because that's very important. If you two were intimate or lovers, he might have killed himself so you could have the money. He would never kill himself! He wouldn't do that. He was tough, and full of life and hope! Go on. What's your relationship with Dr. Woo? Who do you like more? Are you really an insurance actuary? Does it matter who I like better? Because... That's because... You and Dr. Woo could've killed Onion. My God! What did I say? Have I lost my mind due to jealousy? Mr. Cheuk, you are the worst man I know. The lowest, the most caddish pest! Ms. Autumn! I'm actually... Fisherman, the towel! Do you have epilepsy? You'd better have a checkup. God! You can't reveal your true identity. Even if you want to, you can't. It felt like you were there. I could yell at him louder because of you. Sorry about what happened. I don't know how to explain it. I am Onion and Cheuk. It sounds ridiculous, but it's true. We don't disappear when we die. We just live in another place. Do you remember you cut my hair 13 times? You cut my right ear once too. You asked me if it hurt. Aside from this letter of apology, I'm making this recording to be safe. I am Onion and Cheuk. Believe me. I know it's ridiculous. Remember the night before I died? You saw a shooting star and made wishes. For me? Thanks. I get off at ten. Let's have dinner. Dinner? I can't... How about supper? -I won't trouble you. -Not at all. Really, I'm free right now. Can I have the flowers back? What? Such a cheapskate! You gave it to me. Did I say that? Look at what you've done. You want it? Take it! Sorry. I know it's for Autumn. I could tell from your eyes that day at the cemetery. She has the day off, though. It's a mess, but I don't think she would mind. Take it. Out of pity? It's for you, really. I get it, thanks. I feel great. Hope you are the same. You will see her. She's at her sister's. The address... I know, she told me before. Thanks. Are you all right? Why are you trying to learn swimming so suddenly? You used to yell when I washed your hair at the sink. I thought you're scared of water. I didn't dare to do anything because of my fear of water. Until it was too late. From now on, the more I'm scared, the harder I'll try. Hold on. Let me get a notebook. That was deep. I need to jot it down. You're teasing me! -Take this. -Thanks. I bet you didn't dare to confess your feelings. And now it's too late. Am I right? Do you think I won't splash you because you're pregnant? How dare you? Aren't you here for help? Here we are. I can't go further. Three hundred dollars. How far ahead? Not far. Just follow the road. What's up? Tell me something. What happened to my little sister who used to be so strong? Thanks for the compliment. I'm fine. Okay. Was \"strong\" a compliment? I thought it meant bad-tempered. Come to me when you want to talk. Let me. Stay still, Your Highness. I hope you always treat me like a queen. Dr. Woo? I guessed right. You are here. I was around the area and decided to try my luck. Guess it's my lucky day. Around the area? It takes at least two hours to get here. Where were you? This place is near the airport! I went to see somebody off, so I dropped by. Are you that hungry? You bought so much food to the airport. Well, it's cheap there. So... Never mind. My sister. Actually, I came to see you. I was worried and wondered if you're okay and eating properly, so I bought some nutritious food for you. I'll leave it here and have a chat for a while before I go. Since you're already here, come and sit. Don't stand at the door like statues. -This is Dr. Woo. -Hello. -Hello. -How are you, baby? It's a naughty one. Doing flips all the time. It's a handful. How nice of you. We live so far away and you still came. It was on the way. Stay for dinner then. Sure. My sister needs to talk to someone. Let me help. It's heavy. Have you decided? Isn't it a bit impulsive? You should've been prepared for these things when you chose this career. Years ago, when my first patient died, I thought the same way. But I told myself, many things are out of my control. If you give up because of that, you shouldn't have ever started. Excuse me? Are you hot or just doing facial with the cool air? It was just getting interesting. She's quite funny. Yes. She's simpler. How about you? I know what you mean. The seniors say, when you see patients die, go and look at the newborns and you'll feel better. But he was not just any patient. He's Onion. You won't understand. I didn't believe it before until it happened to me. I can't go on. Let it out, you'll feel better. Don't worry, I won't leave so irresponsibly. I'll stay until the end of this month. I'll help the newcomer get used to things. I need time. Give me time. I think I can change your mind. Thank you. I feel much better now. Coming. Who are you looking for? -My sister? -Yes. What a crowd today. I'm surprised so many people are here at my rural home. Are you dropping by too? No, I came to see her. I have to talk to you too. Really? I called you but they said you were on leave. Sorry about last time. I want my indemnity. I won't reject anything from Onion. That's fine, but-- You are an insurance broker? What is your name? My last name is Cheuk. Mr. Cheuk. It's getting more and more complicated. You came so far for the indemnity. Very nice. Stay for dinner. Sure. What's this? Watch it. You'll know. I'll watch it later. Mr. Cheuk. Mr. Cheuk, he's calling you. Mr. Cheuk. You are really hardworking. You're taking care of a case even during your leave. I want to settle this quickly for Onion. Dr. Woo, you work hard too. Are you on leave too? Mr. Cheuk, I don't think we've met. How did you know my name? We've never met. Since I'm doing insurance, we need to know everything. Onion died too suddenly, so we had to check on people close to him. Sorry, it's an occupational disease. A blind guess. Mr. Cheuk, you don't look too well. Your lips are dark. You're sick. You'd better get a checkup. It's professional advice, not a blind guess. Just now, I queued up and bought a cheesecake. Let's have it for dessert. Try it. You'll feel better. Autumn hates cheese. She only likes fruit candies. The octagon ones in colorful cans. I can't believe it. An insurance broker even knows what someone likes to eat? I don't eat cheese. How did you know? Are you checking on me? -You think I killed him? -No. How could I? I didn't mean it that way. In fact, I am... -He's having a seizure again. -What's happening? Is he okay? Miss, do you have slippers? For men or women? Better get it checked at the nearest hospital. Just in case. Where's Autumn? She's in her room. You made her angry. I didn't mean to. I didn't check on her. Please tell her. Okay, sure. You threw up everything you ate. Have some cheesecake. Miss. The doctors often suggest to avoid heavy meals after vomiting. No cheesecake. Do you have something blander? Have an apple. Here. Can we talk, Dr. Woo? Sure. Can we donate Onion's money to the hospital's ophthalmology research? Onion's wish was to help those in need. Sure. I can suggest to the hospital to set up a fund for the blind. How about that? I always thought you were busy and didn't have time to go to concerts. Now I know. I am quite jealous of him. Sorry, it seems disrespectful to our dead friend. But I'm sure that Onion wouldn't want to see you like this. Are you free to go to a concert tomorrow night? Can we talk tomorrow? I hope to see you tomorrow. It's getting cold. Let's go. It's late. You should go. Give Mr. Cheuk a ride, will you? Where's Mr. Cheuk? I don't know what it is that you want. No matter what, I won't let you hurt Autumn. I don't have time, Dr. Woo. Stop the car. Do you want to vomit? Thank you for taking care of Onion. Bye. Hey, where are you going? I won't let you go back and bug Autumn! Will you please get in? I'm not leaving. I didn't ask you to leave. I won't let you bother Autumn. Let me go back with you. Okay? Mr. Cheuk. Personally, I don't like you. But as a doctor, you are a patient to me. You might get pneumonia or trigger epilepsy. Will you get in? Thank you. I must keep an eye on you. Hey, you're wrecking my car. Do you want me to call the cops? You like her. You do too. I do. She told me she cared about me. You've been to our hospital? Did she take care of you? But the way I see it... I think you've got it all wrong. What do you mean? Nurses always care about the patients. Especially someone like Autumn. But that's different from what you think. I am not saying this because I like her. I hope you get it. Did she read the letter? Would she believe it? Maybe Dr. Woo is right. She just pitied me. She cared for me as a patient. She never liked me. I get it. You wanted me to regret, right? How could angels be so cruel? Good morning. -Good morning. -You didn't go home. No, since I have a date with you, I thought I'd better stay here in case I oversleep. -Where is he? -Who? Mr. Cheuk. My car was locked. He didn't leave? Never mind. Come inside, I'll make some coffee. -Have a seat. -Okay. Can you give me a ride later? Where to? Anywhere, to take a break and then go to the concert. Sure. Did you read it? You waited a whole night here for this? I read it. Good! So you get it? I am sorry, Mr. Angel. I was irrational last night. You didn't hear a thing. Are you okay? Did you really read it? You didn't miss anything? I don't know what's written in your apology card. And this tape is blank. But I accept your apology. Please proceed with my indemnity and stay away from me after that. If you're free, come by for a visit. We're in the ophthalmology department. I know. I specialize in the blind. I'm always there. So I understand them. Sometimes, I even try reading Braille. Like Onion's diary. I learned a lot from it. Diary? I didn't know she'd react that way. She even asked to meet tonight. But not because of me. She just wants to see Onion's diary. But I never had a diary. That was a bluff. In order to meet her, I need to get a diary. Sorry, I didn't feel like staying. It's okay. The show was boring. I'll take you home. No, it's fine. Thanks for the ticket. You're meeting someone? Him? Don't worry. I can take care of myself. Give me a call if you need me. Diary, oh, diary. You can't write a whole diary in a day. What the hell. There's no time. I'm sorry I'm late. It's all right. I was early. This is... I think you shouldn't see it. I don't mean anything by that. It's in Braille. You know how to read Braille? Sure, it has been more than ten years... Because I specialize in the blind. Could you read it for me? Okay. Where do I start? How about when you two met? \"Sunny... Sunny... It was sunny.\" That's it? No, there's more. \"October 16, 1997, sunny, vomit. Dr. Woo said it was a medical reaction. A new nurse came to take care of me today. Her name is Autumn Yue. She is clumsy. She kept saying sorry. She made a mess, but I didn't pick on her. I even feel good about her.\" Why am I not having a seizure while talking about the past? She still doesn't know who I am. To her, I am just a stranger reading Onion's diary. Go on. \"November 2nd, 1997, rainy night. Autumn said she'd come to give me a haircut after work. It's raining so hard. She might not come. She is already 49 minutes late. I thought she wouldn't come, but then I heard footsteps. - 'Sorry, so sorry.' -Sorry, so sorry. - 'Sorry. I'm late again.' -Sorry. I'm late again. The 49 minutes didn't matter. I was thrilled she came. Finally, she finished cutting my hair. I looked like an onion. So she started calling me Onion ever since.\" \"December 7, 1997, Sunday, good day. It's the second time Autumn cut my hair. Her scent really stood out to me today. Just when I was immersed, I felt a nip on my right ear. And then she kept saying, - 'I'm sorry. Are you okay?' -I'm sorry. Are you okay? - 'Gosh, I cut your ear. Sorry.' -Gosh, I cut your ear. Sorry. - 'You're bleeding. Are you okay?' -You're bleeding. Are you okay? I shook my head and reassured her that it was okay. But she freaked out and was about to start crying. If I could talk, I would tell her, I'm so glad she came. That little pain didn't matter.\" Enough! Stop reading. I am sorry. Please burn it. What? He spent a lot of effort to write this. Don't you want to know more? So what if I know it all? You won't understand how I feel. Onion was the only one who could. He's dead. What's the diary for? Don't you want to remember the memories? No. You know what? Just now, I felt Onion's presence again. I used to think I just pitied him. But when he died, I realized how painful it is without him. I've loved him all this time. Why didn't I tell him? I wanted him to know. I wished he was the one playing the sax. Why didn't I ask? My second wish was to be with him. Why didn't I say it? Now it's too late. Can I start over? What's the use of memories? Just one day. Give me one more day. Please! You! You guys killed him! Why? -It's not my fault. -No! He came out of nowhere. It wasn't our fault! Go on, scram! I've got nothing left anyway. I shouldn't have come back! I shouldn't have. Let me go back. Hit me! I miss you so much. You always miss me, don't you? Sit. What do you want to drink? Anything's fine. Your daughter? 7 Up with salted lemon. Thank you. Easy there. You will drop dead. Do you want to die? No, I don't. My neck is sore. Give me a message. When are you leaving? To Taiwan. In two days. Are you coming back? No. Sit. You're leaving, so why stir things up? You can't take anything with you. I know now. I wanted to see her. If she's happy, I'm happy. You've seen her. Don't expect more. Jumboball is right. If Autumn knew that Onion is leaving again, she'd be upset once again. What's that? You wanted to open a flower shop, right? Consider this an investment. I can't take it with me anyway. I can't use it in Taiwan. Okay. I'll send you some next time. What do you need over there? I'm going. Take care. Hey. If you see my daughter, help me take care of her. I will. Don't bug others anymore. Go quietly. It's not fair occupying others' things. Hello, you're on air. It's me. I can't hear you clearly. What's your name? Cheuk. Mr. Cheuk, what do you wish to talk about? I want to say that I've been wanting to call in since I was young. But I couldn't. I'm leaving in two days. I've done everything I need to. This is my last try. It's nothing special. Since you've done everything, do you feel good? Better than how I felt a few days ago. A few days ago? You felt bad a few days ago, why? Because I saw the reality of the world. The reality? Do you mean its ugly side? No, the world is not ugly. But the world is different when you see it through the eyes. Through eyes, you'll have greed. You want to have them, possess them. The eyes fool you. Interesting. Tell me more in detail. I would like to remind everyone not to see with the eyes. Quietly close your eyes in this minute of silence. Feel the world with your purest heart. You may find things to be different. When you feel the beauty and happiness with the heart, you'll have room... for more imagination. You seem to know yourself, Mr. Cheuk. Could you hold? We'll talk more. Now, let's listen to some music. To those tuning in, if you've experienced something similar to Mr. Cheuk, why not give his suggestion a try? Close your eyes. It may help. You startled me! Sorry. I shouldn't call you so late. It's okay. What's the matter? I know it is not scientific. But I really feel like he's back. Slow down. Who's back? Onion. I feel his presence. Very close to me. I'm a doctor. I don't believe in the paranormal. I know how you feel though. You're imagining things because you miss him too much. That's normal when a close friend dies. Should I come over? That's not necessary. I know what you mean. I knew you'd say that. But I know it's not just my imagination. Onion is back. Okay, now. Sorry for bothering you. Good night. Good night. Goodbye. This is the real Cheuk. The one we met is a crook. I've checked. He's on vacation in the States. For your own safety, don't meet him. Let's report him to the police, okay? No. He never came again. Are you okay? Take care of yourself. This is my final night. Why are you following Autumn? You want to make her happy? I can help. That wasn't me. The one who played the sax wasn't me. I don't want to lie to you. You mean Onion played it? It was Cheuk. Cheuk! Cheuk! Cheuk! \"I don't play the saxophone.\" Onion! Come out! Cheuk! Onion, come out quick! I know you're here! Fine. You're not coming out, are you? Are you okay? What's wrong with you? Do you want to kill yourself? So dumb. I should have known that you were Onion. And you're the one who played the sax. Onion! Stop right there, Onion! I am not him. Onion's blind and mute. He's dead. Stop imagining things. There are others out there for you. Such a fool! I am the insurance broker, Cheuk. You know that. No, you're not. No, I'm not. I am a liar. I tricked you. Are you happy now? You hated me anyway. Tell me the truth. Is there something you can't say? Is there a special reason? Why are you rejecting me? I'm not. I am not who you think I am. Fine. That night, you read one line from the diary, but told the whole story about Onion and I. How did you know? Unless you are Onion. It's fine if you won't admit it. I'm sure you have your reason. Just don't leave me alone. I am so careless. I didn't realize who you were until I saw all the proof. I am so dumb. You're leaving? Are you going to leave now? Yes, I have to. You'll never see me again. I am not anybody. Forget everything. Onion is dead. He'll never come back. You must take care of yourself. Go. Just go! Sorry. I'm just going to take one more minute. I have one last question. If you were him, seeing the one he loves in so much pain... What would you want her to do? Forget me and love someone else. Live happily again. Let go of the painful memories. Okay! I'll tell him now. I've forgotten his death. I won't carry the pain with me! I will love someone again. And that person is you. In my heart, he has never left. It's fine if you won't admit that you're Onion. I don't care if you're Cheuk or not. Because I know, in my heart, who it is that I truly love. Onion, you listen up! I love this person in front of me! Don't go. Don't leave me alone. The meteor shower is happening tonight. China is the best place to see it. I'll be here with you tonight. Onion told me that your first wish was for him to regain his sight, so you could see the meteor shower together. I'm fine with you. There's no meteor shower yet. You're a good person. God will help you. Really? Then help me keep Onion. Stay with me forever, would you? That's my second wish. Onion had a second wish too. But it's already impossible. It's 2:30 in the morning. Ten minutes to go before the peak hour. I wonder if Mr. Cheuk will call again tonight. Hello, I'm Cheuk. I appreciate the people who care about me. I want to use this opportunity to say something to my love. Why not say it to her directly? Because... of fate. When I hadn't expected anything, I unexpectedly received her love. When I wanted her or had a choice, she hated me instead. When there is hope, there is also disappointment. I am leaving soon. I'm leaving with the most unforgettable memories. Be it laughter or tears, I hope every bit of the memories will remain with the person I love most. I hope she'll carry on with her life and be strong. Five days is very short. But I want to tell those who are listening to cherish what you have. Whether now, or in the future. Even if it slips away, I have no more regrets. That's so touching, Mr. Cheuk. If only you were my boyfriend. Anything else I can do for you? Could you play a song for my beloved? Okay. I don't want to get in the way of the meteor shower. Before I hang up, I hope everyone would close their eyes again. Feel the person next to you with your heart. It will feel much more special. Meteor shower! It's the meteor shower. I've fulfilled my first wish. Make a wish, quick. No. I did it last time, but you're still leaving. I can't be too greedy. Remember, you'll return when the meteor rains down. WAIT FOR YOU I finally understand the meaning of a meteor shower. They are tears of the sky.", "url": "https://subslikescript.com/movie/Xing_yuan-213314"},

Telegram for Mr. Fan Thanks Young Master, your telegram \"Mom is sick, return to Hangzhou at once\" Is Hangzhou far away? Not really...just a few days by train Fengshian, take my word.

I sleep only to see him in dreams I've been missing him night and day Constantly pining for him Our love grows amid the distance in between Our thoughts are together amid the hardship faced The sparrow comes and goes The tide rises and falls It's spring again With flowers blossoming again Nature has come to a full circle With another year going on to the next The day of your return is not yet seen A lover's away can nowhere be seen With tears in dream I asked for your return May the stars lead your way back to me With tears in dream I asked for your return May the stars lead your way back to me Master, come here Gusheng, how are you?

There is a lady who looks just like you She is so vain that she has forgotten her love And the oath she made by the lakeside A lustful woman that will fall for something new Who is she that you're talking about? I'm referring to my fiancee A heartless woman A shameful woman that will go with just any man What are you doing? I asked you to cheer her up And you've made her cry Don't you want to live? Generalissimo, you're mistaken Just like me when I've mistaken my fiancee She is actually laughing Why did you say she is crying? Is she laughing now? Yes, she is now at the top of the world How can she not laugh? She spits blood Fengshian has vomited blood Come Yes Take him out to execute Yes Hold on Lishia Generalissimo, if you kill him just like that You might be acting too rash! Your wife spits blood out of weakness Just now we've all heard him He didn't say anything offensive to your wife Just now, you have also seen your wife laughing Was she laughing just now? Was madam laughing just now? Yes... She's laughing, she's laughing What's more, if you can actually release him Then the whole world will realize that... you're a just man with a sense of integrity Then they will come to respect you more Is that true?

Stop beating her... I'm so mad at her... Give way... Calm down... Don't stop me. She needs a good beating I've tried so hard with all my connections ...to get her a job at the Generalissimo House This damn girl has the guts to say no Can you imagine how mad I am? Generalissimo She looks a lot better today She'll recover soon Look at her, she doesn't look good at all I've brought her all these treasures She don't even look at them I got them all for you You really have no interest in them? How dare you! If it was someone else... I would have killed her long ago What's there to see, get out... Get lost at once Generalissimo, didn't you mention about ...getting someone to take care of madam? That's right Very good What do you think of this maid? Miss Chen What? You know each other? She used to live in our neighborhood See, she speaks You're good Vice Officer Yes I'll keep her no matter how much she costs Generalissimo What's up? An urgent call from the North They want you up there at once What rubbish! I've tried so hard to make my baby speak again Now they want me to go North? Just inform them I'm busy Generalissimo, the situation there is critical I think it's better for you to call them in person You all good-for-nothing Miss Guan, how did you get in? I am here as a maid How is my mother? She's keeping well. She is staying with Mr. Fan Miss Chen, Mr. Fan asks for your forgiveness He's actually right, I'm a cheap woman already How can I face up to him? Please tell Mr. Fan that, After my mother passes away ...I'll repay him with my life Mr. Fan is very sorry for what happened that night He said, if he can see you... and apologize to you in person; Then he can die in peace I know You love Mr. Fan very much Don't you want to see him? Of all the days... why it has to be today to go astray? You're all good-for-nothing Adjutant Ding Yes Go to the train station at once Order the train not to leave It has to delay for half an hour for me Yes Baby, I need to go North I'll see what I can find there And I'll get a train load of stuffs for you But, don't you try to see a man while I'm away This is a good chance I'll inform Mr. Fan at once ...to wait for you at the pavilion No Miss Chen, even if it's just for one word Still you should go to see him ...to settle the matter Fengshian, I've wronged you You can blame me for all you want No, I'm at fault for letting you down It's me that has let you down No, you did nothing wrong Let us flee and leave here No I'm no longer someone you met before How can I flee with you?

That I have my oath for you, I said The sea may dry up and the stone may fall apart But we have to stay together forever Fengshian, I love you I love you even more than ever Jiashu Since the devil is not around Let's leave here immediately You go back to pack and inform Xiuzhu I'll inform your mother and Brother Guan Tonight at eight o'clock We'll wait for you at the back door Sixth madam, you're back Madam Madam Madam Madam Where did you go? Didn't I tell them that I went to the temple? The temple? Maybe you're mistaken I just went there and no one is around! You can't imagine the train to have broken down So you went to see your man Tell me Who is he? I'll get him and execute him No... No? Okay, I'll beat the secret out of you I need someone here Yes, Generalissimo Take her out Yes, take her out Yes Let's fight with them Brother Guan... Brother, let's calm down first There are a few hundred of them And there's only a few of us Going just like that means certain death So we give up? No, let me go back there To see how it is with Miss Chen Then we'll think of a way to rescue her What are you doing? I got food for her Miss Chen Miss Chen I'm Xiuzhu, I'm here to bring you food Time creeps away without a trace left My wish shines like the moon, the bird sings for me Mr. Fan, you really don't mind about my low status? How is she today? Not much progress Generalissimo, I don't think she can recover Even if you're really mad Still you have to tell me his name He's... Who is he? A bowl of rice Damn, I'll shoot you No, Generalissimo... Get off No, Generalissimo You're also good looking I'm hurting all over Come to my room to rub me some oil No, Generalissimo Take it easy, let's go Please don't Time creeps away Without a trace left My wish shines like the moon The bird sings for me Good, you have a nice body I think you'd look even better when naked Generalissimo, what are you doing? Didn't you say to rub you some oil? Oil? What oil? No, Generalissimo What are you doing? What am I doing? I want you to sleep with me No, no... No one dares to refuse me Generalissimo I don't really mean that I mean don't rush into it Since you've bestowed me with such an honor I'm more than willing to accept that But to get married I need to pick a good day And I also need red candles How can I wait for this kind of thing? Let's get married now, and have the banquet later No, don't do that It's all for your good If the girls from our village need to get married They must pick a good day to hold the wedding ...or their husband will die from curse Both my elder and younger sisters' husbands died My father's elder sister's husband died His younger sister's husband has also died Death comes even earlier for the bald head Generalissimo, how's that? If you don't mind Then I'll strip right away No, I think we better pick a day This is a good chance Pretend that you will marry him He'll be more off-guard on the wedding day Keep a watchful eye on him When there is a chance Cover the lamp shade with a handkerchief After we rescue Miss Chen You will leave with us Mr. Fan Get a boat ready at the North Pier outside the city After we rescue Miss Chen All of us have to leave at once We can't stay here anymore The biggest problem now ...is the checkpoint inside the city We need a car that wouldn't have to... stop for inspection at the checkpoint So that Miss Chen can leave with us smoothly The only way now ...is to ask for help ...from He Lishia, daughter of the Treasurer Jiashu, you sound very urgent over the phone What has happened? Miss He, let's talk over there! I guess you know all that has happened to Fengshian We're going to rescue her I think you know that I love you very much It's actually to my advantage that she's not around I can understand that Then why do you still want me to help her? I know this request ...may come as a bit harsh for you But, I love Fengshian deeply Miss He Last time at Generalissimo's place you saved me Why can't you save her this time?

Tell me about it. \n \n \n \n    (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n \n Daddy was looking at me. Darling, it was only a dream. Come on. But he was taken away. He left us. Now, you know that. He'll come back. He still loves us. Of course he loves us. Go to sleep. Good night, darling. What's wrong? Don't worry, Analise, it's the same thing. Shall I talk to him? I don't understand this nightmare. I thought he'd got over all that. He needs a father. But you're here. He doesn't like me. - That's not true. - It is true. He's obsessed with Sam. \"Daddy did this.\" \"Daddy could do it better.\" It's been three years. How can he remember all that stuff? He likes you. Does he? Of course. He doesn't feel that you're his father yet. You just need more time together. What is it? Can you see anything? Stay in the car. Get back in the car! Ben? Ben? - We continue our late-night concert... - Ben? With Sviatoslav Ashkenazy's interpretation... of Debussy's 29th Prelude... Ben? Leave it! Come on, let's go. Mummy! - Mummy! - Tony? - Mum. - Hi, Tony. It's all right, sweetheart. You've had a bad dream. Let's go back to bed. What is it? What's the matter? Hm? Hungry? Din-dins? There. Who is it? Who is there? Who's there? Divine! Come back! What do you think you're doing? Divine! Divine! Where are you? Come back! Divine! Come on! Be quiet! Feeling better? Are you angry with me? What's wrong? Is it Joe? - Daddy's hurt. - What? Oh, God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Joe! Don't be frightened, Mum. Where does it hurt? I won't be cross. Don't worry, Mum. Joe! What's the matter? Call a doctor. - Christ! What's he done? - Quickly! Analise! Get Analise! Hurt? - No pain at all? - No. Then where did that blood come from? - I don't know. - From you? Daddy sent it. How did he send it? Dunno. Just felt something sticky. I think it's time you got some sleep. Into bed then. Thanks, doctor. Is that all? - Goodnight, Tony. - Goodnight. Snuggle right down, sweetheart. Night night. Sleep well, love. There's nothing wrong with him, is there? He appears to be perfectly healthy. If he'd lost that much blood, he'd be too weak to tell us anything. He hasn't told us anything anyways. I'll test his sample, of course, but I'm quite certain it's not Tony's blood. Well, if it's not Tony's blood, whose is it? You're saying he's pulled some grotesque prank? Why? Could your husband possibly have been in contact with Tony? - Without your knowing it? - No. I think you're making a big thing out of it. He's a resourceful kid. He has a big imagination. He doesn't need Sam to help him come up with a trick like that. Joe, just say out of this, please, will you? I think we can all agree that Tony has had a rather traumatic experience. And he does still seem to insist that his father disappeared in this bizarre manner. Yeah. He won't accept that his father ran out on him so he has him disappear in a flash of light. Psychology 101. Mrs Phillips, may I suggest that Tony might benefit from some professional help in this area? Listen to me. Tony simply misses his father. He doesn't need thousands of expensive psychiatrists, only a little time and care. Hold on, Analise. Just let him finish. It's just a suggestion. I'll ring you tomorrow and if you'd like me to arrange something for you, you can let me know then. Good night, Mrs Phillips. Goodnight, Miss... Mercier. Miss Mercier. Come on, he's doing his best. Yeah. Stupid doctors. All a doctor can think of is another doctor. Oh, come on, poor thing. You need a rest. It isn't Tony. It's Sam. What do you mean? I mean all this nightmare business. It reminds you of Sam. And what about Joe? Oh, I don't know. I don't want to think about it. OK. Good night. Sleep well. Night, Analise. Thanks. See you in the morning. Hello? What? Ra... ch... el... Who? Er... Look, Mummy. Mummy, watch. Marvellous, darling. Finish your breakfast. Finished a one-mile hike. Analise? Analise? Mum, his trousers keep falling down. Oh dear, darling. - Joe, get Analise. - OK. Come on, Analise, let's go. Tired. What time is it? Tony time. Is he going to school? Yup. - What about last night? - Forget it! Is she awake? I don't know. With her it's hard to tell. Morning, Tony. How are you doing? I'm OK. Listen, I'm going to be doing some pictures of old aeroplanes today. Why don't you come along? Maybe even get you a ride in one of them? - Maybe. - Ah, come on, you'll love it. Don't really know. Tony! I don't want Harry in the kitchen. Put him back in his tank. Don't worry, Harry. Daddy likes you. I like Harry too, but not in the kitchen. And he's not going to school. Oh, Mum! I'm doing those shoes today with Paula. Can you come and look after the lab work? I'm picking up Tony. What about Analise? She's got other plans. Oh, I see. She's got other plans. What did Tony say about last night? I didn't ask him. I'm not going to push it. Hey, Tony! School time! Come on, Tony! Morning! Hello! And how's my little Tony? - I could eat you up. - Tony, come on. - Getting so tall! - Eugh! Work hard at your lessons, young man. Diligence pays. Tony! Sorry about that. Are you all right? Shit! Oh, leave it! - I've got to go. - They'll ring back. - I can't. - It's not important. No. Hello? Rachel. You're not busy? Well, do we need any food? Mm-hm. How much? Yeah, yeah. What size? Well, what about liver? - Are you all right? - No, no, it's OK. I... I just had a pain. In my leg. No, it's OK. - Look, I'll pick Tony up. - Yeah. I'll see you about five. See you. How long have we got? Long enough. OK, Paula, could you stop eating? We don't want to see the crumbs on your toenails. Kev, can you just get rid of that stuff? That's good. And dust off the shoes. That's it. - Nearly there, Joe. - OK. Now... Hang on. Can you remove the food, Kevin? Take it away. Oh! I haven't finished yet. I don't want to see your fat foot here. Thank you very much. Paula, you're not selling an orthopaedic shoe. OK, Paula. Could you just arch the foot a bit? Think of that foot as your face, and smile. Cheese! Bloody cheese! Paula, let's stop messing around now and just look beautiful. - Kev, give me back my sandwich. - That's it. Have you rounded up those dupe negs yet? They'll be at the lab at four. - I'm off to get Tony. - OK, I'll see you later. Listen, we'll have to do one more for Lloyd so just keep the novocaine on the foot, OK? I'm going to take him to the zoo. See if he'll talk to me. Mm, it's a good idea. Paula, please stop drooling. Hello? Where's Tony? Has he been kept in? No. His father picked him up. That's impossible. A few minutes ago. You just missed them. It can't have been Tony. I saw them leave myself. Which way did they go? Tony! Tony? Hi, Mum. Sam! Hello, Rachel. Mum! Your mum's upset. You bet I'm upset. Good to see you, Rachel. Looking well. What are you doing here? - I'm back. - You're back? Back from where? I'm not sure. You're not sure? You disappear for three years without a word. I don't know where I've been. I can't remember a thing until today. - I saw Tony in the street so I... - You want to come home. Like it was. That's it, isn't it? I knew you'd come back. They didn't believe me. Who's they? Three years, Sam. Three years. You wait here, Daddy. You'd better clean yourself up. There's a razor in the bathroom. I'll get you something else to wear. Do you want a drink? Still Scotch? Please. Dad! Say hello to Harry. Hello, Harry. Whoa! He's beautiful. Daddy, are you going to stay with us? Are you back for good? Yeah. He picked up Tony from school. Oh, yes, I'm serious. He doesn't know. He's lost his memory. Mum said you can wear these. Harry's laid four eggs. How long before they hatch? Well, wait and see. Eugh! That's Joe's. How should I know? Joe... Joe, please just get over here. Who was that girl with you this morning? Analise. She lives here. What does she do? She helps Mum. She's French. Better? Do you recognise this? Yes. I think I do. Sam, what's the last thing that you remember? The cottage. We were at the cottage. I was with Tony. You'd gone away. - Then it started. - What did? First this light, this brilliant light above me. I could see Tony was scared. He... He kept yelling but I... I couldn't hear him. It was as if I was held in that light. And a wind, a strong wind. It was hot. Felt good. Sounds like one of Tony's stories. Was it you on the phone this morning? No. Joe will be back in a minute. Hello there, Miss Goodman. Ooh, good evening, Mr Daniels. I see you're walking up the stairs again. Yes, it helps me get to my apartment. Oh, so it's your apartment. I see Mr Phillips is back. I'll miss our little talks. Come on, Dad. - Rachel? - In here, Joe. - Hi. - Hi. - Sh-sh! - That one. Oh, Daddy! Well, Sam, how long have you been back? Um... Just today. Where are you staying? He hasn't arranged anything yet. Tony, time for your bath. - I want to stay with Daddy. - Tony... You going to be around for a while? Oh, for the time being. What are your plans? - Analise, Daddy's back. - I don't know. I haven't got any work lined up, if that's what you mean. Mm, things are pretty tight. Won't be easy. I hear you're busy. I've been lucky. You know me, Sam. Look British, think Yiddish. Joe, would you like a drink? Yeah, that'd be nice. - Sam? - Um, no thanks. Analise, keep an eye on Tony, will you? OK, OK! So you've been... taking care of things, have you? Yeah. Look, Sam, what do you want? I want to be home. This isn't your home any more. That should be obvious. I'm just bringing these in. I can't handle this. Look, I don't know what to say to the guy. He thinks he's going to move back in. Well, give him time. Time! He has had three years! He has got to go. Where could he go? This is the only place he's got. Rachel, he walked out on you. I don't know that he did. I see. He can't remember anything. That is garbage, Rachel. He tried something new. He ran away on his family and it didn't work out so he comes back. What else do you expect him to say? You don't know him. I married him and I lived with him. And now you live with me. I just don't trust him. Tony. Tony! Tony, supper time. Come on. Hurry up, darling. Tony, where are you? Tony? Tony? Joe, have you seen Tony? Isn't he with Sam? Joe, he's taken him. Tony? Don't hide from me. What's the matter? You were eating Harry's eggs. I needed them. What for? I'm not the same as before. Do you remember when they took me? Yes. I went to another world. I had to be changed so I could live there. Why did they take you? I was lucky. It could have been anyone. Why did you come back? I came back for you. - And Mum. - Of course. Do you want to come with me? Don't be afraid. I'm your dad. Going to catch your death of cold, you are. Joe, we'd better call the police. We should never have left him alone with Tony. That's what he came back for. Come on, Dad, it's my turn. Come on, Dad! Where have you been? We went to buy some sweets. Well... Would you mind letting me know where you're going next time? Of course. You haven't done that properly. No, I haven't stuck... Oh, another one! And now news of fresh disasters. I'm speaking from the car park where only hours ago the hideously mutilated body of a young woman was discovered. One senior police officer said, \"This is an act of the most monstrous brutality.\" - You look different from your picture. - Really? Mm, you look much younger. Don't you think so, Rachel? I don't know. I haven't thought about it. A change is as good as a rest, right, Sam? Gets you back in shape. It is odd you arrived at this moment. You know Tony's been dreaming about you. I'm glad he hasn't forgotten about me. Did he tell you what happened last night? Yes. He's missed me. - You two get along? - Oh, very well. He wants you to stay, you know. How long will you be here? - It's not up to me. - Not long. - It's not up to you either. - Please. - As a matter of fact, it is up to me. - Joe! Because Rachel's divorcing you. - Joe, not now. - But why not now? Everyone's here. Right. So I have a little announcement I'd like to make. Rachel and I are going to get married. - Oh, great! - Thank you. I'm so happy for you. Sam! You crazy maniac. You're out of your fucking mind! Daddy! Daddy? You didn't have to dump that on him. He should be in a hospital. What is it, son? It started on its own. I didn't mean to. I was just thinking about the noise it made. That's all it takes. If you think hard about something... ...you can make it happen. But I couldn't stop it. - I tried. - Look... You'll be able to do lots of things. Don't be frightened. Use it when you need it. What for? Well, you'll know when the time comes. You'll feel it. Like when you were hurt by that car? I knew what was happening. Remember, it's our secret. We're a team, right? Right. Do you like Analise? Perfect. It's just what we need. But... you mustn't damage her, OK? I think this belongs to your son. Oh, God! Harry! It appeared in my supper. How did it get there? I'm not interested. Clearly your son is not responsible enough to look after animals. Anyway, it's ridiculous keeping a snake as a pet. I'm sorry. She's just a stupid woman. Tony... No. Tony... Look at me. Later. - Night. - Bonne nuit. I've hunted out some more of your own clothes. You didn't throw them out. Good night. What are you going to do? Look, he can't stay here. You know that. Oh, don't push me. Letting him stay isn't going to help, and it won't do Tony any good either. Hello? When he left I knew exactly what I'd say to him if he came back. And what I felt. And now I don't know. If that's how you feel, what the hell am I doing here? Darling, I'm sorry. That's not what I meant. That's Miss Goodman. She killed Harry. Quick! It's Mum! If I hear another squeak out of you tonight, I'll be very angry. - Do you understand? - Yes, Mum. That's her again. I hate her. All right, I'm coming! Oh! What do you want? Morning, parrot. Have some breakfast. Here. Come on, speak to me, parrot, huh? Why don't you speak to me? Do you remember when that was taken? I'd just painted the bedroom ceiling. You can see the paint in my hair, look. I can't remember who took it. I did. On the timer. Oh yes, you balanced it in the tree. God, it was so hot that summer. - Telephone! - Coming. - Is it Joe? - No, it's a doctor. Oh. Hello? Oh. Well, that's a relief. No pain at all? No, no, he's been OK today. Um... However, he might be able to talk to someone more... Thanks. Yes, thank you for phoning. Analise, could you take the stuff that's ready to the cleaner's? That way we'll get some of it back by this afternoon. Don't you want me to take this? No, I haven't finished with it yet. And I'll finish the stuff in the bedroom too. OK. See you later. Come on, Tony. Let's go. - Who's this? - OK, I'm coming. - And turn that off. We're going now. - OK, I'm coming. I don't know. It was in your jacket. Well, I've never seen her before. Oh, come on! You must know who it is. She's probably worried about you. And this? I mean... What day was this? Whose boat? Well, maybe it isn't my jacket. Or your money? Hi. I didn't think you'd be working today. Just checking some stuff. How are they? They'll do. Do you want some wine? No, I'm driving. We're going to the cottage. Who? Well, me and Sam. I thought it would help if I took him there. Mm-hm. It's the last thing he remembers. It hasn't been easy for me either, you know. I found this in his pocket. Lousy shot. Look on the other side. He doesn't know anything about it. Fine. - I'm leaving Tony with Analise. - Good. Can't you feel any sympathy? No. Joe, is this OK? - Let's take a look. - Hello, Rachel. Don't you like it? I think the blue one's better, Paula. Oh, I think it's really nice. I thought you'd given up doing that sort of stuff. I've changed my mind. Sam's waiting. Bye. Sorry, Sam. I want to play hide and seek. You're too old to play hide and seek. I want to. Well, you can't do it here. There's nowhere to hide. Go into my room. I'll be there in a minute. Tony, will you be OK playing on your own? I've got to lie down for a while. You're always lying down. What is it, Tony? Can we play hide and seek now? I got a little headache. Later on perhaps. I think we should play now. - Can I come in? - Wait a minute. We'll have a quick game. Just a quick game, OK? Big deal! Stay in here. I won't be long. 17, 18, 19, 20. OK, here I come. I'm going to catch you, Tony. Tony! Analise! That's enough, Tony. Going up now. Analise! Come and get me! Oh, it's good to be back here, isn't it? Sam? Someone's been here. Gas? Open some windows. How long's this been on? Ugh! Nothing's missing. Shall we report it? Let's go for a walk. I want to see some more before it gets dark. OK. Ana? Analise? Tony? Analise? Agh! I love this place. I wonder if Tony's treehouse is still here. He never came here, you know, after you left. I think it was over here, wasn't it? Ugh! Sam? Sam! Someone's been here as well. Sam. What is it? You're shivering. Is it something you remember? You're so cold. I missed you. Do you want some more wine? Yeah. Thanks. We used to have some good times here, didn't we? I mean... This was more home than London. - Do you come here with Joe? - Yes. You're not too sure about him, are you? - Well, it's just... - You're not. Are you? It's not like that any more, Sam. I'm going to phone home. See how they're getting on. Hello? Hello? Tony? Hello? Mr Knight? It's Mrs Phillips here from number six. I wonder if you could go and check out my apartment for me. Tony and Analise are there on their own and I can't get through. Delighted to help. You leave it to me, Mrs Phillips. No problem. Thanks. It'll be a pleasure. Bye. Bitch! Ugh! Cheap foreign bulbs. Nothing works properly in this effing country. Who's there? Tony? Is that you, boy? Stop messing about. One of your practical jokes, I suppose. - Hello. - Joe? - Rachel. - Sorry to disturb you. - How are you? - I'm worried about Tony. - Have you tried calling? - No, I can't get through. I called Mr Knight to check things out. He hasn't called me back. Yeah, look, would it help if I went to see if Tony's OK? Would you? - Sure, I'll go. - Thanks. - Just see that everything's OK. - Mm-hm. - I'm a bit worried about them. - Mm-hm. OK, I'll call you from the apartment. OK. - Bye. - Bye-bye. Oh no! What are you doing here? Analise dropped me off. Why? She went out with Michael. You mean she just left you alone? Never mind. Just get in the car, OK? Come on. Where are we going? We're going to the cottage to see your mum. Great! Darling... Darling. You've hurt yourself. Your face! No! Don't go. Rachel... I'm sorry. Are you...? Are you hurt? Stay here. Why? Just do it. Don't open any of the doors, OK? Lock it. Rachel. Rachel? Where's Tony? He's in the car. You've got to get into the car and drive away from here. Christ! Come on. - He's gone! - Look! What is that? Oh! Tony! Tony! Tony! Tony! Tony! Tony!", "url": "https://subslikescript.com/movie/Xtro-86610"},

Whafre you doing? You alright? You're hurt... You guys go that way! Don't let her get away! Hurry! Como Inside. Understand? You speak Japanese? Boss, the cops are here. How dare you let this happen on a night when I'm on duty. Hey, It wasn't like we instigated this. Just one shot? So who did It? Everyone who was with the boss got Iced. There are no eye witnesses. Yaguchfl Your punks have been tearing around Kabuki-cho like wild dogs! They wouldn't be If they didn't know who you were after! Officer. I wouldn't be sitting here with my thumb up my ass if I knew who did it. Got a high pain threshold. There, all done. It's you... Fujlnaml... I'm closed for the night. We're looking for a Chinese woman. Can we look around your bar here? I'm closed for the night. You prick! Zip It. If you come across this Chinese woman, give us a call would you? Sure thing. Move It. - Right Boss. You're sure In trouble. You should stay put here for a while. I feel so hot... Don't tell me this was your way of saying thanks. You're a strange woman. What's your name? Rin- Ran, ls It? My name's... I know. Fujlnaml. The yakuza called you that. Are you yakuza, too? NO. I can't stand the yakuza, Oh? Glad to hear It. You speak Japanese well. My mother's Japanese. Hey, the yakuza will still be looking around out there. I'm okay. Thanks, Mr. Fujlnaml. Yolchl. Everyone who's close to me calls me Yolchl. Then goodbye, Yolchl. Did you hear about lshizuka? What do you think? That the boss was old. Is that all? Yeah, pretty much. A waitress ran off from the scene. She's Chinese. I feel so hot... That Chinese woman Is our one and only lead. The Talselkal gang is out looking all over for her, too. You'll let me know If you hear anything, won't you? Why are you asking me? Because you're the only one Yaguchl fully trusts, In the end. I'm not yakuza, You left the yakuza, but you can never fully leave your past behind. Isn't that so? I'm not so sure. I'm meeting Ho here. Yaguchl? He'll see you alone, okay? Fine. Ho says It might be the Pasel Ding. Pasel? What the hell Is that? The most dangerous underground gang... In all of Hong Kong. Pasel Ding, or the Untouchables'. These guys won't die even If you shoot them. They were Red Guards, and were also In the army. They've seen a lot of action. They know how to handle guns and explosives. They'll take on any job, no matter how dangerous. They say a woman killed him. There's a female fighter In the Pasel Ding. Called 'Ran', or the Black Orchid. She was a guerrilla in Afghanistan until recently. The Black Orchid... Congratulations, Yaguchl. On becoming the gang boss. Mr. Ho. The only way for me to become the gang boss ls to flush out... the woman who did It and blow her away! It's not difficult to find someone who can got in touch with the Pasel Ding. I'll put the word out. Good work. Take that table. Welcome to the club! I'm Chan Li. Let's have a good time. Let's got a hotel room! Are you drunk already? You okay? What am I supposed to do?! My visa': up and I have to go home soonl? Bastard! Shut up you goddamn skag! Have you gotten used to this type of work, Ran? You won't make any money unless you start taking clients. Are you sending money back to your family? No, I'm not. Oh, well In that case... you don't need to take a bunch of clients against your will. My case is a bit different. My parents are walling for me to send money each month. But a big portion of the money goes to my loan from the snakehead... so I can'! send my parents much. How much ls your loan? Two million yon. It's gonna take me another two years to pay It oft. A woman from my village came back from Japan just loaded with money. She rented the entire Shanghai Hotel and held this huge party. That's how I met my snakehead. He told me I could have this great life if I came to Japan. So I borrowed a bunch of money from my relatives and came to Japan. I never imagined that I'd have to lick the private parts of Japanese men... in order to make money. Anyway, I'm gonna have a great big party too, once I get back to the village. I'll invite everyone from the village, and hold a huge feast! Sound good, Ran? Let's got going. Look. It's morning again. Now it's our free time again, until night. It's almost the end of the month. I hate nights at the end of the month. Why's that? Because the Mafia comes. The end of the month is payday. They make us go to hotel rooms. You were an Informant for the Pasel Ding In Hong Kong. You know the Black Orchid, don't you! Yeah. She's In Japan, Isn't she! Who hired her?! I don't know who hired her... honest! I didn't even know she was In Japan! She came to see me out of the blue, about a month ago. She was asking about two men. Two men? What men? Ishlzuka, president of the Talselkal. And Mr. Ho. You! The Black Orchid said she wanted information on the two of you. What the hell?! What does It mean?! Why?! I don't know, I don't know! My job's just to get paid for giving out Information. I don't know a thing. Who the hell's this 'Black Orchid' woman?! Don't you have a photo?! A photo of someone in the Pasel Ding? If you had something like that, you'd regret you ever lived. What did you tell her about me? The address of your condo. The club you run. That you have three women, and sometimes shy overnight at their places. So I told her their addresses, too. She's after me? Ran? Yolchl? You sure disappeared into thin air! The boss of a yakuza group called the Talseikal was murdered. They're searching everywhere for a Chinese woman who saw it happen. Ran, yakuza who've had their boss killed... They're like a pack of hungry wolves. I'm not scared of the yakuza, You should be! I don't wanna talk about this. You smell good. I'm all sweaty. No. You smell like 'Roi Fa'. What? Rel Fa. Pear blossoms. Rel Fa. Beautiful name for a flower. There are lots of pear trees In China. They'd be In full blossom right about now. Rel Fa was my little sister's favourite flower. Your little sister? Is she in Japan as well? She's dead. Rin- Stay here with me. I'd like to stay. But I can't. Got work to do. On the left ls a female fingerprint we pulled from the crime scene... where the Taleelkal president was murdered. The print on the right is that of a woman who assassinated a politician... In central Hong Kong... along with all the cops who were in the immediate vicinity. So the killer Is the assassin, the Black Orchid. She doesn't hesitate to leave her fingerprints all over the scene... meaning she doesn't even take the cops into consideration. So some gang summoned the Black Orchid from Hong Kong... and hired her to kill lshizuka. Perhaps not. She might have had a personal vendetta. A vendetta? Who's this? Six months ago, in a twelve-story apartment building... a Chinese club hostess named Clm Kan was discovered, out down. Her body was sent back to Hong Kong even though the perp wasn't found. But In Hong Kong, the rumor was that she's Black Orohlcfs younger ulster. Her little sister?! Are you suggesting she came to get revenge for her little sister?! Chu Kan, a so-called 'hostess', worked at a club run by the Taiseikai. If this murdered Ohu Kan turns out to be the Black 0rchid's little sister... then it's going to mean big trouble. It won't end quietly. Hey, take a hike. Good evening! That girl over there's new. She's a real stick In the mud. Call her over for a bit. Sure. Know who I am? The manager's boyfriend. A scary guy. I'm not especially scary. Have a seat. After the club closes down, you're coming to a hotel with me. Alright? Alright. Drink It. Ever see a chicken get killed? NO. You hold its neck and body still like this. Pretty scary. Then you give It one good, hard twist. Then the bright red comb starts shaking like jelly. Poor thing. You can't kill It outright though. Otherwise the meat will get tough. I like eating chicken. Mind If I use the ladies' room? Do It here. Don't be shy! This ls my club. Do It. My feet are soaked. Throw It here. Chan LI! Where am I? My room. What exactly are you, anyway?! You're better off not knowing. Get some sleep. Will you stay here by me? Okay, I will. But get some sleep. Get anything? No, not yet. Get a bloody move on! Yes sir! Some guys from the Talselkal were here around dawn. They were asking where two women, Ran and Chan LI, had gone. When they said they didn't know, they started roughing the women up. 'Ran'? You mean the Black Orchid? They say she hangs out with this Ohun LI. Hey brunette, come here! Is Chun Ll this woman here? Hey! Put her on the wanted list! Ra\"! We caught that 0mm Ll skunk! The stupid cow went back to her apartment to get her money! I'll round up some men. Yaguchi, let us finish off the Black Orchid. Oh no, you won't! We're taking down the Black Orchid, for what she did to the boss! So don't go getting any Ideas! Think you guys can handle her?! We'll send out our own men, too! Ho wants to meet you. Yeah? Tonight, at twelve, at the Balkan Wharf. We'll give that Chan Li chick back to you then. Long time, Yolchl? Yeah. I know... you don't let yakuza In here. But this ls the last time. I won't show my face again. I don't like the sound of that. I'm sure you didn't come here to tell mo that. We found out who killed the boss. She's called the Black Orchid. An assassin from Hong Kong. But as It turns out, no matter how many men we send out... we come up pretty much empty-handed. So... I asked the Taiwan Mafia to find her. Pretty Impressive. No wonder you're the No. 2 man for the Talselkal. That's a smart plan you've come up with. Nothing smart about It. Even you know that the Taiwan Mafia are indiscriminate, right? But the truth is... we can't just kill her outright. Someone hired the bitch! If I don't get the assassin to tell me who it was, and kill them... I won't be able to hold my head up on the streets of Kabuki anymore! You understand, right? Yolchl. I really need your help here. Okay? Listen, I'm not yakuza anymore. Yolchl, you haven't forgotten, have you? Got him! You got him! You got him! You got him! Yoichl! Let's got outta here! Yoichi! Give me the rifle! I'll say I shot him! You 're hurt, you can't escape! It'll be to my advantage even if the cops catch me! I'll get promoted! Gimme the rifle! I blew your gang boss away! It's been five years since then. You've become a clean man. But whether you're a yakuza or not, you have to return a favour. All you have to dole keep her from getting away. We'll take it from there. Yolchl. I need you. Understand? Ho... Get over here! Move! Come out, Black Orchid! Come out, or we'll kill her! Ra\"! I feel so hot... Yaguchl, get outta there! What's that? Mo, you're not Ho. Boss! Boss! Yaguchfl Boss! Boss! Ran! Ran! Show yourself, Black Orchid! We'll kill her! Drop the gun and come out! Ra\"! Chun Ll! Run! Get in, Chun LII Where's Ho? I dunno. I haven't seen him since we got here! Then I don't need to be here. Yolchl? Shoot her, Yoichi! That's her! That's the Black Orchid! What the hell are you doing Yolchl?! Shoot her! Shoot her! Ra\"! Chun Ll... why? I can make some money if I kill you! You don't mean! The Mafia boss promised mo! That he'd pay me a lot of money! And give back my passport! I'll be able to go back to my village... and have that big party. You kill people for money too, right? So what's wrong with me doing the same thing? Chun LI! Chan LI! Ho! Black Orchid. You've got a lot of vulnerable points. Think so? You won't shoot now. I'll just wait for my men to show up. Whafro you gonna do? Listen, Ho. If you shoot mo, Ran's gonna shoot you. We'll see. I'm not so sure she has It In her. Wanna watch and find out? Alright! Are you game? Ran, just go ahead and shoot me. Ran, over here! Yolchl. Yeah? How're you connected to the yakuza? With fetters, I guess. With fetters? Yeah. Yaguchl and I got our first hooker together. We broke the Windshields of guys In a rival gang. We were shaking in our boots. We used to blow all our money gambling... than share a bowl of noodles at the roadside stand. We're bound to each other. Are you still bound, even now? No, I guess not. Where are you going now? Kabuki-cho. It'll be crawling with yakuza! Ho's still alive. I hear you. Yolchl. Promise me you won't Interfere, when we come across Ho again. Why?! That man Isn't human. Hey, Ran. If I hadn't]umped outta the way back there, would you have shot? Forget It; I don't wanna know. I know what kind of woman you are. Here, gimme a hand with this stuff. My client and I are done hero. What's in there? That room's empty. But someone seems to be using It recently. It's nothing to write home about. I'm just not the cooking type. Oh yeah, that's right. You need passports, don't you? I know a guy In the fake passport business, so I'll ask for you. He'll be In the yakuza, so It won't work. Oh, yeah... I sure am stupid! Sorry about that. Don't worry about It. Because I really am stupid. You're infatuated with her. I can tell. Whafre you talking about? You're still a full-blooded man. You like to get your fill of danger. Get off my case. Let's see your wound. This Is the second time you've treated my wounds. Yolchl. What Is It? They're here. Black Orchid. Come out. No. This ls my war. Yolchl! Run for It! Hurry and go! Move It! Black Orchid... If I twist this sword out, he's a dead man! Get outta here, Ran! I know the Black Orchid a lot better than you do. We're only just getting started. Stick out your tongue and lick it. It's my penis. Take it Inside you. You really think you forced me to come here? So this is how my sister died. I finally figured out why my little sister's genitals were butchered. What are you talking about? Six months ago, you and lshizuka had a little party. You called in some women and were living it up. One of those women was from Hong Kong. Her name was Chu Kan. She came back to Hong Kong as e butchered corpse. I remember now. She was cute, with fair skin. Chu Kan was my little sister. 0h yeah? So that's what this ls all about. Well In that case, Black Orchid... I'll kill you to boot! Shoot her! Kill the bitch. Not you again. We can't find Ho. He's disappeared. Then ask Yaguchl. Yaguchfs disappeared too. I'd like to know where they are myself. Up until three days ago, I was practically on my deathbed! Hey, Fujinaml. Where's the Black Orchid? Couldn't tell ya. You! You wanna know where Yaguchl ls. What's wrong? Look at that guy. Yolchl! Where's Ho? Don't! I knew a man who could stand It up to the third finger. He went insane on his fourth. I'll tell you, I'll tell you! Ho's In a summer house In Chiba that our gang uses for smuggling! Yolchl, do you know where It ls? Yeah. Rin- Why'd you kill Yaguchi?! If I hadn't killed him, he would've killed me. I don't wanna wait until sunrise. Let's get It over with. No, Yolchl. Why not? Because you'll slow me down. Think I'm stupid enough to bust Into that house prepared to die? If I use this, I could wipe out everyone In the house... no matter how many there were. Don't you understand, Yolchl? I'm not a romantic. I'm not such an idiot that I'd give up my life in exchange... for the lives of those Taiwan Mafia punks. The reason I want to wait until sunrise... ls so that I can get a good look at him In his death throes. I'm sure my little sister wants to, as well. How long are you gonna let this go on for?! I don't know myself. But I don't think it'll be forever. It won't end until someone kills you! Don't you get it?! Yolchl. What do you want from me? Will you hold mo? I wanna sleep until morning. And lfeel like I could fall asleep, if I were in your arms. Can I? Yolchl. Do Tzue. What the hell happened hero? Vice Squad, go to the second floor! I'll take the first floor! Fujlnaml. What happened to Ho? He got half his face blown off. Where's the Black Orchid? Guess she took off. Gone back to Hong Kong? Who knows? But there's no point going after her. You'll never catch her. You didn't go with her? I couldn't go. If I'd gone with her, I'd have to watch her get killed sooner or later. I couldn't see the woman I'd fallen for got killed. The last thing she said to me was 'Do Tzue', Do you know what It moans? Do Tzue? Yeah, It means, 'I'm grateful'. Grateful? Seems like something she'd say.

A girl must marry on coming of age Please sit down Besides Master Lin is offering 1000 taels of gold He's treating your daughter like a lady You're quite right Master, we can't accept the proposal Don't be so short-sighted Master Lin is a handsome fellow He's rich and powerful He's a good match for your daughter Just the betrothal gift alone Who else can offer this much? That's not it. My daughter has been... Don't mention that Please tell Master Lin I have agreed We're from a well born family as well about my daughter... I understand Don't worry We'll go through the proper rituals And send the bridal palanquin Good... It's settled Yes! I won't agree to this Miss... Your father has accepted 1000 taels of gold as the betrothal gift It's useless to worry What can I do? You should discuss with your mother Yes Yi Chun Look Is that Master Chen? Looks like him! He must be looking for you Why? He doesn't know we live here He can ask his way He must be on his way to the west lake and passed by our house He chose to take shelter across from us? Yi Chun Yes? Give him an umbrella I will Master Chen It's really you Incidentally I saw you from upstairs Is that your mistress? I bet this is not a coincidence You're mocking me! Here! This is from our mistress Thank you so much Where do you live? I'm... Who is that? I don't know You have such a kind heart Uncle Li! Young Master Why are you out in the rain? I don't care Young Master Look at this umbrella! Master! It's nice, huh? Did you buy it? No You found it? You're excited No I was on my way to the West Lake I was caught in the rain I ran into a lady while taking shelter She gave me the umbrella You don't have to get so excited It's worth nothing, but means a lot Even if it's pouring I won't get wet The lady who gave me this is from a distinguished family Who is it? On the night of the lantern festival I met Huang Bi Jun at Master Lu's The one you talked about yesterday? Yes Huang... what's the name? Huang Bi Jun! What a coincidence! A Miss Huang from the western part of the city There's a pair of stone lions outside her door Stone lions? Stone lions! The Huangs? What are you thinking? I'm thinking When your father was alive You were engaged to a Miss Huang from the western part of the city That's right! Your mother told me When they exchanged the betrothal gift We offered a precious mirror In return The Huangs sent a coral tree Yes! The coral tree is indeed at home What if Miss Huang is my fiancee? Master, then what will you do? Well? When the engagement was agreed Your father still held office Now that he's dead You have not made contact The connection died with your father As for the engagement It may not be The world is full of snobbery It's hard to say Now that you have brought this up I must find out if she's the one What if they renege? What will you do? I'll sue them Don't be silly They're rich and powerful Before you file your complaint You'll be beaten up first Forget about it! Mirror polish! Do you need to polish mirrors? You know how? Yes! You really know how? Of course! Come in! What's wrong with you? Stop staring! Follow me! Put it down! Wait here! I'll get the mirror This is the backyard Stay where you are Yes... You have the mirror Is this your mistress' mirror? It's mine! Do mine first I'll get hers Talking to me? Want me to go upstairs? I'm telling you to work on the mirror And don't roam around Hey! I'm here to... Are you Yi Chun? You are... I'm Chen Bo Qing Master Chen! Why are you... I'm here for... What's wrong with you? Stop chatting Don't pay attention to him I asked him to polish the mirror Do you want me to polish a mirror? No! Yi Chun, the mistress is looking for you Run along! You're dishonest! Me? Miss This is the one! You're bad Miss Be careful! I will Take your time, I'll get you some tea Miss The mirror inlaid with jade I've seen it as a child It's now a part of her vanity and linked to my fate The mirror remains while things have changed I'm not who I used to be Bringing up the engagement will be hard After I polish the mirror I'll have to leave I won't get to see the fair lady or talk to her I came in disguise I would have wasted my effort I'll break the mirror and see what will happen Here's your tea! You're supposed to polish the mirror how could you break it? This is ridiculous! The mirror was a part of the family hairloom How can you pay for it? Sir How could you entrust such a precious mirror to someone like him? It's not my fault It's Yi Chun... Did you bring out the mirror? I did Sister! I caught you! What are you doing here? Wu Niang Why are you hiding in there? Father Who wanted the mirror to be polished? I told Yi Chun to bring out the mirror Really... The mirror is broken You 2 brats go back to the study I don't care who brought it out You break it, you pay for it I'm broke I can never pay for that mirror I broke the mirror Please forgive me Forgive you? Not so easy? If you don't pay for it I'll send you to jail I don't have any money That won't do any good Get my name card Father, the mirror is broken Sending him to jail is useless Even if I don't I can't spare him I'll work for you And pay for the mirror Work as a servant? Yes... Look at you... You can't do any chores If I let you stay I'd be wasting food instead No... What? I can cook and clean I can also read and write Really? Yes Alright The mirror was a valuable heirloom You'll sell yourself as a page boy for 3 years! Agree? I agree Chen Bo Qing serves in the study as a page boy He prepares the ink and pen and continues his studies Outrageous! You have no respect Rotten wood is useless A wall of dung cannot be soiled What? Who taught you that? Sir My glasses! This is outrageous! Such moral degeneration! What does that mean? You're hopeless! Why didn't you practice calligraphy? Chen San This is for the teacher Who is this for? For the old master Chen San I thought this was for him No, I saved them for you Save them for yourself What's with you? I'm doing this for you Look what are you doing? You're both hopeless Simply hopeless! Master Meng Yi Chun What are you doing here? Master Meng is gone Yi Chun, fetch Chen San  Yes Chun Tao Leave those for me! It's alright. I have nothing else to do Where should I put them? Give them to me Chen San What is it? Sit down The 2 youg masters have driven Master Meng away There's no one in the study That's even better Let's sit down and have a chat Sit down! Have some tea What are you looking at? Is that for Huang Gui? No way! He's not worthy What do you think? It's nice The design, handiwork and colors are nice You're making fun of me No, I'm not Really? Of course Are you lying? Why should I! It's not for me! Guess who this is for? For the Master? The old geezer? It's for the mistress She has no use for it I don't know You look so smart But you're foolish I know... Who? Master Meng It's for you Oh, for me How nice of you! Do you like it? Of course You can have it when it's done Chun Tao Huang Gui mentioned 2 mistresses I have only seen one That's Wu Niang. The other is San Niang. She's married Wu Niang Wu Niang What is it? Nothing! I'm just thinking Let me tell you Wu Niang is engaged You might as well forget it That's not what I mean What do you mean? This is not the study What are you doing here? Don't get me wrong You should know better Go to the study, the master is looking for you Chen San Let him be Let's talk What about? This is not the living room What are you doing here? Miss I have good news What is it? The young masters have driven away Master Meng Why is it good news? I'm not finished Master Chen... Say no more Fine! I won't say a word Alright! I'll tell you Master Chen is a learned scholar Your father... I don't want to hear it What a waste of time I got excited over nothing! Yi Chun What about my father? I thought you don't want to hear it Just tell me Now you want to know? Forget it then! Alright! I'll tell you Your father appointed Master Chen as the new tutor The new tutor? Xiao Liu, give it back! You're the tutor now But you don't look it How should I look? Tutors wear glasses You need glasses to look like a tutor What's wrong? I can't see! Get back to your studies Her chamber is far from here I'll send a message with the drawing I need a messenger I'll have to count on the boys A drawing of flowers and a pair of lovebirds There must be a hidden meaning I'll send him lychees I send her a drawing She sends me lychees A pair of lovebirds in exchange for joint branches Chen San Call him master Why aren't you eating? No! I can't! This is for worship I can't eat them! Chen San Let them eat it I have more No... Great No, you can't! Let them eat yours I brought this for you I knew you'd be here, Chun Tao What's the matter? What is it? This is the study, not the kitchen What are you doing here? That's none of your business Come back! Chun Tao! Go study! Chun Tao, come back! Damn! Chun Tao Master Lin You 2 are perfect for each other Have a seat, Master Lin Is Master Huang home? He's away When? 2 days ago I want to see Madam Huang Have a seat Be studious and diligent Have a sense of shame Discipline yourself And you can rule Chen San What is it? Come take a look! At what? Come on! What is it? Please tell Master Lin We'll have to wait for Master Huang Madam Your husband agreed to the marriage And accepted the gift If Master Lin had not been sick He would have married your daughter But... Do not hesitate Let's do it No! It can't be done! It's already settled Your daughter is getting married What's the problem? My husband is away I can't make decisions We must wait for him It's just the same How can that be? He's the head of the family It is out of my hands When will Master Huang be back? In 2 weeks I'll send for you Okay... I better go, Madam Sir... Oh no! What is it? The tutor has fainted Chen San! His longing for her Makes him pine away in bed Chun Tao sends him medicinal bowl  Bo Qing reveals his love to Wu Niang Chun Tao I'm actually engaged to your mistress My name is Chen Bo Qing Really? When Chun Tao heard the news She left in a hurry and told Yi Chun Wu Niang was shocked by the news Is he really... Yes and he's ill You should go see him Yi Chun He's resting in his room I can't go to him A broken heart needs a special remedy But none is available You should go see him! The young lady is reluctant The little matchmakers are anxious Secretely they discuss among themselves And come up with a plan Go on! Don't worry! We'll stand watch! Go on! Go on! Miss What are you doing here? Yi Chun is busy I brought you water You shouldn't have If my mother finds out... I better go Wait! Put the water down Miss Not on the floor! Miss Since I saw you I have been suffering Now that I can see you again I dare not ask for such and honor When you came to my house I thought it was due to our chance encounter I didn't realize we're engaged Now I know the truth I'm glad we can meet and we can talk In front of me You don't have to be modest I heard you'll be getting married I feel terrible I wish you would reject me So I can give up hope Don't blame me I didn't want to break the engagement It was my father's idea I must obey him Meeting you that day is breaking my heart now We can never be married we'll have to count on the next life Miss You better go! San Lang! San Lang! San Lang!

I blame my fate for being unable to marry you I will never marry to pay back this moment San Lang... Forget me and find someone else Goodbye Master Chen, please leave  Madam is coming San Lang! Hurry, Master Chen If Madam finds out We'll be in trouble Madam Chen San, how dare you... Mother... Madam You seem polite and decent You should know better and mind your manners How can you come here? Madam, I... Mother, he's... He's what? He's Chen Bo Qinq from Quanzhou Master Chen? Are you related to Chen Zai  the former magistrate of Chaoyang? He's my late father How big is your family? 7 of us Which 7? My mother, my brother and his wife 2 sisters and myself And who else? You mentioned 6, who else is there? It's 7 counting you How can you include me? We are engaged I must count you in I'm telling the truth I know The night of the Lantern Festival we had a joke... Sometimes jokes may come true I hope so But I'm afraid Afraid of what Uncle Lu promised us he'll speak to my father But my father... Well... What? We were engaged while we were young We have exchanged gifts What you gave us was that mirror You gave us a coral tree That's right You have broken the mirror Mirrors cannot be mended No! I fixed it I'll get the coral tree Then your father cannot renege Yes! The sooner the better I'll go pack now And leave at dawn Take care of yourself San Lang San Lang I don't know what to say This jade pendant is a proof of my love Please hurry back And remember our vow The 5th day next month is a lucky day Okay 5th day next month? Yes The 5th day is lucky Best for marriage, travel assuming office and birth Prosperous day for fortune It's the most auspicious day Very well No! What? Of course it is! We have checked the almanac The almanac cannot be wrong That's not what I mean I'm saying it's too soon We don't have time to prepare Why not? Money is the essence It can take care of everything Don't worry I'll handle it Yes! Why are we rushing? We better wait What do you know? A day like this is rare Tell Master Lin we'll proceed as planned Very well. It's settled! Bye Yes! Please! I'm trying to tell you... What? To put it bluntly This is a private matter You don't have to worry If you wish Drop by and have a drink We'll be honored, otherwise... Master Lu is... Madam, we are old family friends Since your husband prefers the rich\t And breaks the engagement I will not get involved anymore Do what is best for you! Goodbye! Uncle Lu Mother, I'll never marry Wu Niang, what did you say? One must be faithful I will not marry someone else I'm engaged to Chen Bo Qing I'm part of his family I will not marry Lin Da Xiong This is outrageous! Mother! You're still wet behind the ears Yet you dared to disobey me I'm telling you You have no choice - Miss... - Wu Niang... - Miss... - Wu Niang... The bridal palanquin has arrived San Lang has not returned I bid farewell to you I cannot carry out my filial duty Madam! It's time for the mistress to leave Please change and get ready No!

Don't listen to him This coral tree was stolen from my house I have reported to the authorities Lin Da Xiong Just because you're rich and powerful Doesn't mean you came frame me Listen This is the proof of my engagement You can't trump up charges against me If I say it's stolen, it must be stolen You're caught red handed, don't bother to deny Guards! Yes! Take him to the magistrate! Go! Master Lin, you can't... Wu Niang San Lang - Miss... - Wu Niang... Mother Miss Miss Don't cry over him You should know The magistrate is my father's pupil I can get him arrested I can also get him out You're a bully Wu Niang! I'll do anything for you! Besides... Setting him free is no big deal As long as you agree Everything can be taken care of It's true, Wu Niang If you don't want Chen San to suffer Father Wu Niang Lin Da Xiong, you used your power to bully a helpless girl like me It's nothing to be proud of Even if I marry you, I won't do it willingly What is this? I'm not bullying anyone I paid you 1000 taels of gold as the official betrothal gift Shut up! Master Lin! Wu Niang It's too late now Only you can save Chen San Fine! I'll marry you Good! It's settled Don't change your mind I want to see Chen San Alright, but you must tell him you don't want to marry him Make him give up, or else... What? Nothing If he doesn't give up, I'll kill him You! Wu Niang Handcuffs and chains came off Chen San was set free He thought his name was cleared and came to see the fair lady Wu Niang! I'm free We can get married You're so quiet! Wu Niang I... You... Master Chen You should go home What? Go back to Quanzhou What do you mean? Don't you want to be my wife? That was before Things are different now You... My father accepted Lin Da Xiong's money I must marry him No one can change that Please go back to Quanzhou Concentrate on your studies If you want to marry the rich You must feel nothing for me When I took shelter from the rain Why did you give me the umbrella? I do good deads all the time I make donations Giving you an umbrella is nothing You're not the only one If you want to marry the rich You must feel nothing for me The other day in the study Why send me the lychees? Our backyards are full of lychees We always distribute them among the servants and maids You're not the only one The umbrella and lychees mean nothing You're lying You sent me to get the coral tree Is that a joke too? It was an excuse to send you away I was hoping you'll never come back then I'll be rid of you If that was an excuse What about the jade pendant? You said it was proof of your love Did you lie about that too? You're a poor scholar I don't want you to die away from home You can sell the pendant And buy food when you're hungry Are you telling the truth now? Yes! The absolute truth? Yes! I thought you are devoted But I have no use for a useless fellow like you San Lang I may be poor but I won't die from hunger I dare not accept this pendant Please take it back! I'll never forget your kindness San Lang! What else do you want to say? I... San Lang  Master Chen San Lang San Lang Master Chen Good! Well done! Get lost! What's with you? Go away! What is it, Miss? Tell him to leave! Very well! I'll leave Yi Chun, watch over her! Wu Niang is forced to leave her love Heart broken He may be alive but he's sick Your medication is ready Drink up Uncle Li Nothing can cure me now Young Master My sickness comes from injustice Unless justice is served Even with the best medicine I will not get well Wu Niang sent the umbrella I mistook that for love A sudden storm has broken the engagement My dream will not be fulfilled Perhaps it's in my fate Master... Uncle Li You... Uncle Li Take care of yourself Return the umbrella Give it back to Wu Niang Tell her... Don't feel bad Take care of yourself I will, go on! I'll go now Take the medicine before it gets cold Master Chen is still here? How is he? He's suffering from depression A broken heart is hard to cure Well... He wants me to return the umbrella So he can rest his mind - Miss - Wu Niang Watch your step Yes Master Lin Where's the Master and Madam? Inside! I'll announce you Don't bother! Tell them Master Lin will come for your mistress tomorrow The bridal palanquin will be here in the morning If you make things hard for me I won't go easy on you either Wu Niang, don't be foolish You must think of me Mother! Madam, Miss Can I say something? What is it? Rather than sending her to Lin Da Xiong why not... let her run away? Run away? Where can she go? Before Master Chen goes home go to Uncle Li and find Master Chen Yi Chun is right But the wedding is tomorrow What can you do? Don't worry I'll take care of it He can't do anything to me Mother...

{"title": "Xiao lan (2022) - full transcript", "plot": null, "transcript": "foodval.com - stop by if you're interested in the nutritional composition of food   ---  \n        Xiao Ian, why didn't you come to me when it happened? What do you mean? I'm not saying that you're abnormal, or should be punished for doing something wrong. But I need to let you know that you have gone astray. Astray? Yes, astray. But I'm very confused. \n \n \n \n    (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n \n Okay. What are you confused about? Talk to me. Sometimes I feel that my body is not mine. Ian Yuyen, why didn't you reply to my message? You left your lunchbox on the table again. Would you forget your own body if it wasn't already attached to you? If I hadn't come, what would you have for lunch? Fine. Hey. This guy really pisses me off. \n \n \n \n    (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n \n What crap is he talking about? Xiao Ian, look at this. We just started chatting he's already asking my cup size. He's even asked me to send photos of my legs. Can this guy chat properly at all? Some guys even want to ask me out. So you going to meet up with them? There's one or two good ones. Look. Check out his abs. What are you doing? Put that away. Shut the fuck up. Getting scared easily stunts boob growth. Let's have a smoke. Smoking will make yours tiny, bitch. Xiao Ian, keep tabs for us. Oh. It's already very big. Oi, why didn't you guys invite me? Hey, was that your mom earlier on? You two don't look alike at all. Local moms are super hot. What the... I'm going to be late for work. Seriously, it's a problem that you can't come. Don't you women prefer long sex? I want to let you enjoy it more. Long sex is one thing, but you can't even shoot your load. I told you not to jerk off everyday. It makes me think I'm loose down there. I never said you're loose. But you've had children, so naturally... I've a meeting, got to go. After you've finished correcting the papers, hand them to my TA. Okay. I won't comment any more on your grades. Even a transfer student does better than you guys. You need to try harder next time. Thank you. Transfer TA? Oh great TA, I've handed back my paper. Put it away for me, thanks. Why do that to Tuzi?　-What? Idiot.　-Who's an idiot. What are you doing? We're late for Tech class. Oh. 196197 so where's lot 198? 198? It's probably just a public road. How can it be a road? A road can't have a lot number. It'll have a problem getting urban renewal. Don't worry about it. Don't worry? Ms. Ian, listen to me... 198 shouldn't be private... Don't tell me shouldn't. Just check to see if it's included on the title deed. If it's not, we want our deposit back, and we're not buying it. But the owner already got your deposit. They came up from Kaohsiung... Just find out who owns lot 198. I wondered where you went at lunch. So this is where you go. What... What are you doing here? Well, I was wondering if lunch tastes better here. Is yours good? At least it's better than the school lunch. My mom doesn't make me lunch either. I prefer when my mom doesn't. Once she got me dumplings. They'd been in the freezer forever. They stank even before I steamed them. But I still ate them all. Well, it's better than no dumplings at all. I don't even get stinky dumplings. What are you listening to? Huh? On your earphones, what are you listening to? I want to go shopping. Want to come? What you want to buy? The hair remover I have cost me $2,000 and it's no good. Hair remover, what for? For hair of course. Arm pit hair, and down there. Don't you shave? Where? Down there, otherwise it gets real messy. When a boy gets hair in his mouth... Damn, that's disgusting. It's normal. Forget it, I'm done talking with you. See, footballers are more handsome than basketball players. Schools with footballers rock. They're alright. Check this out. Lots of girls follow him. But they all got plastic faces and boney asses. Sorry for shooting at you. Wu Miao, what's that all about? Scum. What a coincidence. You take the MRT too? What, only you can take the MRT? Anyway, did I piss you off? What now? Wu Chingmiao, what have I ever done to you? Nothing. Only you can walk this way? That's funny. Another thing, I noticed you're missing a clip on your bra. I saw that earlier. Pervert. See, you're really missing one, right? Don't I care about you? But I've rarely seen a girl so... So what? So... Casual. Go on, smile. Smile for me. Just a little smile? What luck, I'm also eating by myself. How about I buy you dinner? How about it?　-No way. Seriously, I've rarely met a girl with such a good appetite. I rarely meet people who buy dinner just to nag. Let's go dutch. Go dutch my ass. I said this is on me. I know it's just braised pork rice, but I really mean to apologize. Whatever. Xiao Ian, even though it's great you have a good appetite, I actually noticed that... What? I noticed when you slouch down, your belly pops out of your blouse. Wu Chingmiao. Here! You're so annoying. I don't feel like eating now. Go on. Have some dried tofu. Tofu makes you pretty.　-I don't want any. It's too much for me. I bought it for you. I don't want it. Someone just said I have a big belly. I was just joking, just a little joke. Since we're in the same class, will you accept my Instagram request? I don't use IG. What now? I treated you to dinner, bought you milk tea, and you're still upset with me? I'm not lying to you. I really don't use it. Check for yourself. Isn't that my account? You actually fancy me. You can tell me if you do. What the... Hey, isn't that hot chick your mom? Wow. Didn't I tell you she's hot? I'm going home. Are you really related? You're sure? Hey. You're back. Yeah, I was having dinner with a client. Didn't I text you that? Yeah, dinner with a client? Yeah, why? So what did you have for dinner? Braised pork rice. What is it? Are you alright? Yeah. How was school? Fine. What is that? Your IG? What the hell. Will you add me? It's not add, it's follow. Do you even use it? True, not really. I closed a deal today. Let's go out for a meal when I get paid. Yeah. Idiot. Wow, someone bought you milk tea. Who got it for you? Don't know. You can have it. Fine, keep it a secret. Hello. Hi, that flat on Roosevelt Road... Yes, that flat is for sale. You guys put the flyers everywhere. Oh, the flyers, we didn't put them up. That was the advertising company. You'll get fined for that. Yes, that's right, sorry. Sorry, got another call coming in. I'm reporting you... Now let's look at \"The River Merchant's Wife\". This poem by Li Bai is well known for its... Liu Wenzi... What's so funny? Teacher, it's Wu Miao. Wu Chingmiao, what's so funny? Spit it out, let's all have a laugh. Teacher, it's just... Check this girl out. One moment she doesn't respond, then she \"desires my dust be mingled with yours.\" If that's not saying one thing but wanting another, then I don't know anymore. Say one thing want another? How could you say that about such an elegant poem? Teacher, I'm not saying it isn't très elegant. But \"desires my dust be mingled with yours\" sounds very like... they're merging into one. Merging into one? I've told you many times, with all the girls in this class, could you not be more respectful? Teacher, don't you worry about that. The girls know all about that stuff, too. Whoever knows about that stuff can come up here and teach me. Also, Teacher, if people back then merged into one when they turned fifteen, Pervert. Why do adults keep telling us we can't have sex before eighteen, or we're breaking the law? It's sixteen. Fine, fine. Have we actually become more backwards? Stand up right now. How many times have I told you don't talk such rubbish in class? You enjoy standing up? Then stand up. I said, stand up. You're the star, so stand up till class ends like me. Okay, let's get back to the textbook. Let's look at the first line. Girls were \"Maidens\". \"When my hair just covered my forehead\"... Hello. Hello? Oh, the flyers? We didn't put them up. You want to see the flat? Sure, sure. That one has just come on the market. What should I call you? Mr. Tsai? Hello, Mr. Tsai. Okay, let's look at the next one. This is quite a nice photo. As I said before, when you take a photo, you need to use your surroundings. She uses the reflection in the water to capture the lights of the building. Not bad, Kueiyu used the tips I taught you. Give her some applause. Okay, the next one. It's a photo taken by Ian Yu... yen. Well... I can't really see the point of this one. Didn't I talk before in class about basic composition, about tripartition and quartering? But you didn't use any of those. That's okay. You see that's the thing with photos. Just keep trying, practice makes perfect. Okay, let's look at the next one. What are you doing? I thought you were smart, I'm skipping class obviously. So what are you doing? Nothing, I just went to the loo. You're not just skipping one class, are you? I'm out of here. This place fucking sucks. Yeah, it sucks. I'm off. Did you just say that it sucks too? Yeah, why? Let's go then, together. Huh? The good girl dares not to. It's not about whether I dare to or not. So? Holy shit. Mr. Tsai? You're on time. No need to take off your shoes, just come in. Do you have any other viewers? No, just you today. This flat is registered at 110 sq. meters. It's 100 sq. meters inside, so the public ratio is really low. There's great light, too. It's away from other buildings, and the balcony is big. Not bad. Not too crowded. Yeah, there's lots of space. There are three bedrooms. This is the master bedroom. It has a changing room, and lots of storage. Mr. Tsai, don't worry. My company has checked all the pipes. You can call me Kris. Sure. Kris. This sea is so fierce. Huh? I said this sea is so fierce. Yeah. I lived here when I was little. No one goes in the water here. I heard after a short distance, it goes straight down to the bottom, just like a cliff. Look, the tide's going out. Wow, the Pacific Ocean. It's really something. So you lived here when you were little? Yeah, with my grandpa. Then should we go visit him? He died two years ago. After the cremation, I looked at his ashes. I said, Grandpa, you burned beautifully. Do you sometimes feel our lives are just like the waves? What do you mean? Drifting, drifting so aimlessly. Yeah. And so meaninglessly too. What? Does it hurt? What? Do your knees hurt? Nah. Xiao Ian. Ian Yuyen, are you in there? Huh? Open the door, I need to pee. Hurry up. Every single time. A new client was asking me all sorts of questions. Old flats have so many problems. Why are you washing your panties? They had a little blood. Didn't you just have your period? Ian Yuyen, have some fruit. I've already brushed my teeth. I want to sleep. Why did you lock the door? Because I want to go to sleep. I'm off, what are you up to today? I'm going out with Kueiyu. Did I give you your pocket money? Yeah. Here. You gave it already. It's okay, just take it. I'll let you know if I can do dinner. See ya. Oh. This room may feel big now, but a double bed will fill it up. You could have a dressing table. But we have a king size bed. Big enough to roll around in. Nah, we don't roll around that often. Vivi, you really like to joke around. The fixtures are done, and they left some furniture behind. This sofa's not bad. Yeah, you could save money on a sofa. We've already got one, no need for it. What are you taking a photo of? It's just I've never been here before. This place is so cool. Did you dress up for this? The movie's on. What? I want to tell you something. Go on, I'm listening. What are you doing? Someone might see us outside. They won't, don't worry. That day on the beach... What about it? Nothing. What are you up to after this? Don't know. I'll see. Stop it. I can't do it if you keep moving.　-Hurry up. So why you suddenly want your eyebrows done? No reason in particular. Are you seeing a boy? Who's seeing a boy? You're the one seeing a boy. What's the point of a boyfriend? Who needs one. Yeah? Okay. Almost done, last one. Ouch. That hurts. Let me have a look. It hurts so much. Should I pluck your arm pit hair? What, my arm pits? Pervert. Cheers. Good night. Vivi, you know that... I know. I'm a big girl. What now? You want me to grade you? What did I get? （Xiao Ian to Wu Miao: What are you doing?） Forget about it then. Wait a second, you're wearing contact lenses and have a fringe now. Damn, when did you start doing that? What are you going on about? Any louder and the teachers will be here. Can I ask you a question? How did you feel your first time? My first time?　- Yeah. I bled, and it hurt a bit. I know that part. I mean how did you feel? Feeling? Nothing in particular. I don't know. Wait. Did you... With who? What? Who with? It's time for class.　-Who was it? Let's go. Go on, tell me. Tell you what? I was fighting ten of them. So what. I was playing Lauriel so well too. My mid lane rocks.　-Delete the game, you suck. Fine, I suck. Hey. Hey. I messaged you yesterday, you didn't read it. I was busy. That busy? I was only playing games with Wenzi. Oh. What? You missed me? Well, I just thought you can still reply even when you're busy. I was just playing games. I didn't know Line had an instant reply rule. Or Do I need to report everything I do now? I didn't mean it that way. So, what? Not bad, nice moves. Huh? I said, you're quite good at that. Oh, back in high school, I helped out my auntie at her salon. No wonder you're so good at blowing. You're the one good at blowing. That's for sure. Do it properly. Sin equals -sinθ, so what does cos equal? Tan equals -tanθ. But cot is not the same. It's not plus, it's minus cotθ. How about sec? Does anyone know? It's the reciprocal of cos. That's right. It's also plus sec θ. How about cosecant? What are you laughing at? Who started this? Guys, trigonometry will be on the test, whether it's the GSAT or college exam, so you better pay attention. Alright? Now turn to page 25. Do the first practice question. May I? Your pictures. May I have a look? Oh. They're nothing special. That's interesting. What's interesting? It's a kind of \"what's the actual point\" kind of interesting. Stop swiping it. Why? Something I can't see? Why would you want to anyway? So many secrets. Yes, I have so many secrets. But seriously, why don't you get upset when Wenzi bullies you? You could at least say something. Whatever, it doesn't matter. They're not important. Then what is important? What? The class group. I didn't mean it. What does that even mean? Wenzi said you sent it. Of course you meant it. He wanted to have a look, so I sent it to him. I unsent it straight away. I didn't know he'd save the picture, and he shared it by mistake too. It's not the kind of picture you share. But hey, I said I'm sorry. And anyway, soon everyone will forget about it. Wenzi unsent it straight away, so not that many saw it. Forget about it? The whole school has seen it by now, how could they ever forget it? It's not that serious, Xiao Ian. It's just a picture. We're fucking. Now the whole world knows we've fucked. What's wrong with fucking? Is fucking illegal? Has my fucking hurt anybody? If women didn't want to fuck, how could men do it? So we're only fuckmates then? I didn't say that. It's all in your head. So that day on the beach, when you said I was special, all of that was a lie, right? Lie, not a lie. Whatever you want to think, whatever. I'm tired of explaining. You could have said that earlier. Was it really that difficult to say it? Where are you? So you can talk now, where's your wife? You're back. Why so late? Have you eaten? Yeah. It's my girl. Teenagers are like that. They only talk when they feel like it. That's right. Yeah, I know. Xiao Ian, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it. I am a moron, idiot, retard, scumbag, garbage. Please don't be mad at me. Please. I didn't mean to send it. It was an accident. I unsent right away too. How would I know that everyone... Cut the bullshit, moron. Have you deleted that photo? Yes. Is it on cloud? No. Your backup drive? Who would be that perverted? Someone like you. Xiao Ian, don't mind them. There's loads of pictures like that on the internet. Don't think about it too much. I'm thinking too much? Fuck, did I say something wrong? Hello. Hello. What's wrong? Nothing, I'm not feeling well. Not feeling well? Yeah, I have a headache. Mom, where are you? Can I go see you? Me? I'm in a meeting with a client. Go to the nurses office or go home first. I'll go back when I'm done here. Hello? Fine. Who was that? My daughter. She says she's not feeling well. Kids are like that. They say they're sick to skip school. Last time she pulled a sickie, she was swiping her phone in bed. She didn't look that sick to me. So are you going to pick her up? Who wanted to fuck me senseless? Well, it's just... Didn't she say she's not feeling well? Are you alright? So was it really Wu Miao who took the picture? Does it matter who took it? It does to me. Seriously? What matters is the whole school has seen it by now. I didn't know you were going out with him. What difference does it make who I go out with? I don't see any good in Wu Miao. Look, now someone else is asking me out. I want you to be all mine. Huh? What? I want you to be all mine. You want me to be... Xiao Ian. Ian Yuyen. I texted if you wanted dinner, why didn't you reply? What is it? You're not hot. You got a headache? Yeah. Want to see a doctor? Or take an aspirin? Yeah... I'll go get one. Mom. And a glass of water. Okay. You sure you don't want a doctor? It's okay. I just want to rest. Okay, rest then. Okay. If he had shown up that day, she wouldn't have gone away. What does this sentence mean? If he had shown up that day, she wouldn't have gone away. So did he show up that day after all? No. That's right, he didn't. I said I'm sorry. There's loads of pictures like that. If women didn't want to fuck, how could men do it? So many secrets. Whatever you want to think, whatever. Teenagers are like that. I'm tired of explaining. Wenchu. Shenyi. Chiayi. Shenyuan. Wenchu. Shenyi. Chiayi. Shenyuan. Chiayi. Shenyuan. Xiao Ian. What the hell? Xiao Ian, it was nothing. You look very young. Are you sure? Yeah. Hello. Do you have any rooms? It's $680 for two hours. It's okay. Should I call you when time's up? Sure, thank you. You want to take a shower? What is it? Fuck, you're so beautiful. You know that? especially Vivi. Vivi. Hey. What's up with our former champion? I'm really sorry. Vivi, you need to try harder. Sure. One million. Dinner's on you. 1.5 million. Share it with us. You're so wet. What? What now, you said you've done this before? I have. I found it. Do you feel that? The round bump. For the first principle of the third order determinant, the value remains the same. But if you swap any two rows or columns... Xiao Ian, what time is it? Aren't you a bit late? I'm sorry, Teacher. But I did call the Office this morning to say I wasn't feeling well. Alright, just take out your textbook. Let's start over again... You... Why? Why what? This dating around. Why? Do you ask all your fuckmates that question? No. It's just I rarely bump into someone as young and pretty as you. Am I pretty? Not pretty, you're beautiful. So, why do you? Why? Whoever asks first should answer first. Why are you doing this, this fucking around? Because otherwise, we would never have meet. Do you need to go back to the office? Nah, I've taken care of everything. My wife asked me the other day about the scratches on my back. So she does care about you then to notice that. Yeah. One day, she even checked my E-Toll records. You need to be careful then. I'm quite careless sometimes. People usually worry they've left the gas on. When I go out, guess what I worry about? I worry that I've forgotten to put away my vibrator and my daughter will find it. Damn, you have a vibrator? You could just use me. You want to be my viberator? Here you are. Thanks. Hey, about the other day... What? Well, that day outside the toilet... Oh, that's none of my business. However, I just don't get it. You knew I was with Wu Miao. I knew you two had fucked. But there's something you don't know. Me and Wu Miao... You and Wu Miao? Yeah, we started doing it in 10th grade. So now I should give you my blessing or apologize to you? It's not like that either. We're not going out with each other. You're not? You're not. You two confuse the fuck out of me. Xiao Ian, are you still pissed with me? Guess what, I follow you on IG. You are super hot. Jerk yourself off with it then, you're welcome. Kid, you ready? Very good. Okay, next. Ready? What the hell are you doing? Thank you. But why? I remember from your intro that you like cheese cake. Oh, that. I didn't know what to write, so I just made it up. Well, since I bought it, you might as well have it. Thank you. Is it good? Yeah. You want some? Sure. Feed me. Okay. Didn't you say you have a girlfriend? Yeah. Do you buy her cake too? Yes, on her birthday or Valentine's Day, I always buy her cake. Otherwise I'd be screwed. Then why do you do online dating? It's different. Oh. I don't even know your name. Tim. Just call me Tim. Sure. What ya doing? Wait, the cake. You're so wet. You like being fucked by me? Yeah. Will you keep fucking me? Yes, I'll keep fucking you. And will you.. Will you fuck me forever? Yes. I'll fuck you forever. I'm so hungry. I should be the one that's hungry, I was doing all the moving. Stop that. Seriously, what are we going to eat? Whatever you want, I can just watch you eat. You're not going to have anything? Nah, I need to go home for dinner. You can have something small. Then I won't be able to eat when I get home. Oh. So are you buying that flat on Tongan Street? I heard other buyers are in for it. Is that right? But my wife says even with a 30 year loan, the mortgage is still too heavy. Okay. We'll keep looking then. （Tell me a story then.） Are you lying down? Yes. I can start so. What do I get if I do a good job? You can't do that. You want me to read or not? Okay, fine. If I fall asleep while you read, you can have a date. What? You don't want one? Okay, here I go. For a long time, I would go to bed very early. Sometimes, the candlelight would just go out, and my eyes would close right away. It would happen so fast, I'd be asleep before the thought even crossed my mind. Half an hour later, that thought of going to sleep would wake me up. But I'm very confused. What are you confused about? Talk to me. I'm very confused. Sometimes I feel like my body is not mine. Huh? It feels like a fever. When it has a fever, there's nothing I can do. It's out of my control. How can that be? Not have any control over your own body? Teacher, you've got a hard-on. What? I see it. It's okay, no need to worry. You've done nothing wrong, nor have gone astray. You are very normal. Who were you calling? My girl's school, they called a few times. But I'm just getting the switchboard. So how can I know who called me? Have you called her? My daughter? Yes. I texted her, and she said she'd eat dinner herself. Hey, do you have any plans for the long weekend? Why? I'm thinking of going to the mountains or the beach. I've never done it on a beach before. Is that right? But we've planned to go camping. By we, you mean you and her? Yeah, and the kids too. We booked it half a year ago. That site is really popular. Fine, I got it. What now? You know my situation. We both know that only the spare time is ours. The spare time... Ah D, you didn't lock the door. What are you doing here? You said let's have a date. You're Ah D? You're the one who read me that story? I thought you'd work out it was me. Of course not, how could I? Why did you swipe me? Everybody is swiping these days. How did I know you'd respond to me? But why date me? Fine, let's do it then. What the hell. Don't mind Wu Miao, forget about all of that. I don't care what happened to you or what's going on with you now. I just want to be with you. What happened to me? Tell me then, what's going on with me? What's there to forget? Who do you think you are? What the fuck. Are you nuts? Ian Yuyen. I didn't know you were playing around. I didn't know you were either, at your age. At my age? My age is just fine, thank you very much. How desperate are you? Yes, your mother is desperate. I'm desperate for men, is that a problem? Fine, you can play around. But where are you when I need you? You're having dinner, in a meeting, or you're fucking. I'm always there when you need me. No, you're not, you're never there. Weren't you meant to be at school? I was at school. Would you ever look in the mirror? How many boys have you had? How many? When did this all start? Have I ever asked you that? Are you happy? It gives you a thrill? Are you good at it? You going to teach me a few tricks? At least I get a thrill. I've made myself happy. But you're different. You don't look happy at all. I am very happy. You don't look happy at all. I am happy.　-You look like... I am happy.　-What's happened to you? What do you mean by that? Have I hurt anybody? Why is it always me that has the problem? Why it's always me that's wrong? Xiao Ian, do you really know what you're doing? Well, do you? Breakfast is ready, hurry up. Okay. See, it didn't hurt to add me, did it? I've really wanted to come to the beach. Actually, I came here with a boy a while ago... Your classmate? Yeah.", "url": "https://subslikescript.com/movie/Xiao_lan-21881700"}
